<title> Jimmy Hollywood movie review </title>

<h1> Jimmy Hollywood </h1>

<hr>
<p>
Last weekend, I went to see Jimmy Hollywood starring Joe Pesci (Jimmy
Alto) and Christian Slater (William). It was quite funny, though I'd
wait for it to come on video. Jimmy Alto is this aspiring actor
who befriends William who has lost his memory. Following the loss of
his car radio, Jimmy decides to "act" a vigilante (he calls it his
greatest role ever) in order to "rescue" Hollywood from what it has
degenerated to.
<p>

<p>
As one critic put it, "this is a satire whose aim is so unsure that
its principal casuality is itself." That may well be true, but it does
bring out one good point: throughout the entire movie, Jimmy Hollywood
is pursued relentlessly by the cops even though he is doing good for
the entire community. As he points out, instead of pursuing drug
dealers and thieves out on the streets, they choose to persecute
someone who is actually doing good. This reflects my mentality towards
cops in general who intimidate the average citizen for whatever cheap
thrills they can get instead of being fair about it. Regardless of
what the law is, cops behave as though you are guilty until proven
innocent (even though it is never explicitly stated, they surely imply
it). I say this also because of a recent experience a friend of mine
had.
<p>

<p>
It's also interesting to note that Christian Slater's roles have been
deteriorating in each movie he acts. By far, his best roles have been
in Heathers and Kuffs. But besides that, his roles have been rather
mediocre. I think he's one of the best actors around and it's
suprising that he is not more prominent. In any case, he does
surprisingly well in the role of an half-witted person in this movie.

<B>The Return of Phillipe Rushton</B></P>
<P>
University of Western Ontario Professor <B>Rushton </B>appeared at the Poster
Session of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting in
Baltimore to present his race science and was confronted by protesters.  The
AAAS claims he slipped into the session because his name wasn't recognized and
he didn't use the word &quot;race&quot; in his abstract.  They say had it been
known he was coming, they might well have denied him permission to present. 
<B>Dr Joseph Graves</B>, who ran another session at the AAAS on &quot;Psuedoscience
and the Education of African American Students,&quot; attacks Ruston's work.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Metamorphic Robots </B></P>
<P>
<B>Dr Greg Chirikjian</B> of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore has designed a new way for robots to get around.
 Rather than wheels or tracks, the robots change shape, and act like two circles
rolling over each other.

<B>Gene of the Month - The Treacle Gene</B></P>
<P>
<B>Dr Eva Turley</B>, Senior Scientist at the Manitoba Institute of Cell
Biology, our genetics expert, talks about a gene responsible for the way the
features of our faces develop.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Time Traveller - The Giant Impact Hypothesis</B> - from 1987</P>
<P>
<B>Dr Alan Boss</B>, a Theoretical Astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution
told us in 1987 about a theory for the formation of the moon in which a
mars-sized planet side-swiped the earth, and the debris from the collision
formed the moon.  Since then the theory has been tested on computer models, and
is now accepted by most scientists.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ethics of Genetic Enhancement</B></P>
<P>
One of the sessions at the American Association for the Advancement of Science
meeting in Baltimore was on the ethical implications of Genetic Enhancement.  If
we can use genetic engineering to make people healthier, longer lived, or more
intelligent, should we?  Quirks &amp; Quarks producer Ann Stewart attended the
meeting.  <B>Dr. Dorothy Nelkin</B>, a sociologist from New York State
Univeristy introduced some of the issues, including the social problems that may
follow it.  <B>Dr John Harris</B>, a professor of Applied Philosophy at the
University of Manchester thinks it would be criminal to deny people the benefits
of gene therapy.  Dr. Bill Gardner, a Psychologist from the University of
Pittsburgh expressed worry about genetic therapy increasing the difference
betweent the world's &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots.&quot;</P>
