<H2>Message from the President</H2><BR>
<H3>Leading the Way for Change </H3>
<BR>
<P>No matter how you describe it, this year for pharmacy and the Canadian Pharmaceutical
Association has focused on the need for change. We have all been affected in one way or another
by the events of 1995 and have come to realize that together we can meet the challenges facing us
as a profession.<BR>
<BR>
<P>At the 1995 annual general meeting last May, I spoke about the dynamics of teamwork in helping
to manage change. Working as a team has become a key factor in how successful we are at
asserting our role within the health care system. As a profession we must continue to develop and
maintain strong communication links to ensure that we understand each other's position. We must
put our differences aside and come to a consensus to provide a continuum of care, because the
well- being of patients is at stake.<LBR>
<BR>
<P>We must vigourously defend our role as essential patient care providers and drug therapy experts
or our role will diminish in the new health care environment.  Many of us have already made
positive changes to our practice, but we must do more.  Successfully implementing
pharmaceutical care needs to be a priority if we are to effectively deliver on our promises.
Although we are considered the most trustworthy health care providers, we should ask ourselves
why our patients trust us.  Are they aware that we provide valuable advice to help them achieve
better health or do they trust us simply to dispense their medication?<BR>
<BR>
<P>The primary aim for CPhA during this year of transition has been to work together with members
to better promote the role of pharmacists in patient care.  Change is never easy, but we must
adjust our activities if we are to adapt to the realities of the profession. Our efforts this year have
been driven by a renewed focus and commitment to developing a national association that is more
responsive to members' issues and more open to their involvement. A Transition Committee was
set up to map the way, and its work has positioned CPhA to meet the challenges of the future. <BR>
<BR>
<P>As a member, you can be proud of the progress made to date by your association. We have taken
many  important steps including work to develop a new vision for the association that will
redefine our mission and more clearly reflect our new values. More than ever, our efforts have
been focused on developing effective strategies to encourage membership.  Be sure to read more
about these strategies in the section on Communicating with our Members.  The cross-country
campus tours and our membership surveys  since last May have also helped us identify areas that
require action. As you will read in the following pages, we have already begun work on the most
critical issues.<BR>
<BR>
<P>I am very positive about the future of the profession and believe that a viable CPhA is essential to
the well- being of pharmacy in Canada.  If we continue to work together, we can achieve the
goals set out in our mission and ensure that Canadian pharmacists have a strong national voice.<BR>

<H2>Message from the Executive Director</H2>

<H3>Providing You with the Tools for Change</H3>
<BR>
<P>During this year of transition, we have sought new ways to create value for our members. Part of
the value resides in our strong commitment to providing you with every opportunity to become
more involved in the activities of your national professional association. The other part of the
value lies in our products and services - tools that we have developed and enhanced to help you
manage the changes you face.<BR>
<BR>
<P>This year's annual report not only forecasts the future challenges to pharmacy but outlines our
renewed commitment to developing improved member services and taking a proactive approach
to issues.   I am particularly proud of the progress we have made to date and would like to outline
some of the more important milestones as we progress on the road to a new association.<BR>
<BR>
<P>The spring of 1996 marked the first opportunity for you, the member, to have a direct
involvement in the election process of the association.  An overwhelming 8,400 of you were
involved in choosing your representatives to the new Board of Directors.  In addition, over 150 of
you have chosen to be actively involved through the new committee structure comprised of core
committees with corresponding members across the country. Both  of these changes, which
provide enhanced membership input, allow us to be more responsive to your needs.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Although our focus is on the interests of individual members, we continue to strengthen our
communication links with provincial and national pharmacy organizations.  The Pharmacy Forum
at the Annual Conference is part of this process to provide us with an opportunity to share
information on issues of interest to pharmacists.  Our work also includes providing leadership to
the profession and health care by working closely with other organizations representing
physicians, nurses and other health care providers.  Placing pharmacy on the international stage is
also important. Plans are well underway to raise the profile of Canadian pharmacy as CPhA works
towards hosting the 1997 World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in
Vancouver.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Managed care, drug use management and pharmaceutical care continue to be priorities for the
association.  This annual report will outline how we have addressed these issues head on as the
coordinating partner of the National Pharmacy Coalition on Managed Care.  The report also
demonstrates our continued excellence in developing quality information products and research
initiatives that help you demonstrate your valuable contribution to Canada's health care system.  <BR>
<BR>
<P>As a member, you are fortunate to have a committed and hard working Board of  Directors,
committees and staff acting on your behalf. Without your input into association activities, we
would not be able to respond to your needs.  Together, we can anticipate the real challenges that
face us as a profession and develop effective solutions to help manage change.    <BR>
<BR>

<HEAD><TITLE>Meeting the Challenges</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>Meeting the Challenges</H2>
<BR>
<P>In this annual report, we will outline our achievements of the year and look ahead at how we can
help you meet the challenges in everyday practice.  CPhA has already done a great deal on your
behalf to tackle national issues.  We recognize, however, that more difficulties and opportunities
exist.  We are committed to working with you to effectively address the challenges that face you.<BR>
<BR><HR>
<B>Managed Care </B><BR>
<BR>
<P>One of the biggest challenges to pharmacy is the ability of pharmacists to adapt their practices to
the new managed care environment and implement the concept of pharmaceutical care.  We all
recognize the need to assert ourselves as patient care providers and drug therapy experts, but we
must pursue every opportunity to truly deliver pharmacist services that make a difference to the
well-being of patients.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Your national association has been quick to respond to this issue of importance to your
professional practice.  Our work began by bringing together a group of national and provincial
pharmacy organizations to provide solutions to national employers as they grapple with rapidly
escalating drug costs.<BR>
<BR>
<P>This effort lead to the formation of the National Pharmacy Coalition on Managed Care. We have
developed a number of tools and guidelines to help you demonstrate your valuable role in
providing solutions for cost-effective drug therapy. Since May 1995, the Coalition has developed
articles including  Managed Care - A Wake- up Call for Canadian Pharmacists and Managed Care
- A Cross Canada Check-Up.  <BR>
<BR>
<P>To help employers in your community understand your role in managed care, the Coalition is
developing a presentation kit for use with employers which explains the value of an ideal drug
benefit plan.  This tool will be introduced at the 1996 CPhA Conference in Calgary.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Evidence of the Value of Pharmacy Services</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Your feedback and the new managed care environment have confirmed an increased need for
evidence-based research to demonstrate the value of pharmacy services.  To this end, CPhA has
collected valuable data through the Community Pharmacist Intervention Study (CPhIS).  The
study proves pharmacists' worth by demonstrating the cost-savings to the health care system
associated with current pharmacists' interventions.  <BR>
<BR>
<P>In February 1996, Cost Savings Associated with Community Pharmacist Interventions in Canada
was published in the Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal.  It is the first study of its kind in Canada to
demonstrate the economic impact of community pharmacists' contributions to improving the use
and cost effectiveness of drugs. The study is your ammunition to demonstrate your current and
future contributions to saving costs for government and other stakeholders.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>


<B>Enhancing the Role of Pharmacy Technicians</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>CPhA has taken many important steps to advance pharmaceutical care.  In October 1995,  we
held a workshop to expand the role of pharmacy technicians to allow you more time for direct
patient care services. We are currently establishing a national task force to develop a national
certification exam, standardized skills set and  core curriculum for technician training programs.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Changing the Reimbursement System</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Critical to the managed care/pharmaceutical care equation is the need for appropriate  payment
schemes to reimburse you for cognitive services. Since 1991, CPhA has been involved in
facilitating the development of alternative reimbursement schemes by hosting workshops on the
issue, developing research and investigating options. We are currently working with various
stakeholders to develop national standards for a reimbursement plan for cognitive services.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Enhancing Drug Therapy - A Joint Statement</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>CPhA and its Professional Affairs Committee have been active in creating a better understanding
among physicians of pharmacists' responsibilities in patient care.  We have worked in
collaboration with the Canadian Medical Association to develop a joint statement: "Approaches to
Enhancing Quality Drug Therapy". The document is an important step in clearly defining the joint
responsibilities of the pharmacist and the physician in the provision of quality drug therapy to
improve patient outcomes. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Harmonized Drug Schedules in Canada</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Discussions on drug scheduling and the release of the Harmonized Drug Schedules in Canada
report by the Canadian Drug Advisory Committee has provided pharmacists with the opportunity
to further develop their role with respect to nonprescription drugs. CPhA has provided input and
supported the efforts of federal and provincial governments and provincial licensing bodies to
establish a harmonized approach to drug schedules. We believe the proposed new drug schedules
will provide  a further opportunity for you to  demonstrate your value as a drug therapy expert.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Standards of Practice - Nonprescription Drugs</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>It is vital that pharmacists continue to effectively provide advice on the selection  of
nonprescription medications and manage the risks associated with the use of these products.  As a
result, CPhA and its Professional Affairs Committee have been active in providing comments on
the Standards of Practice - Nonprescription Drugs developed by the National Association of
Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities in response to proposals for schedule harmonization.  CPhA's
focus has been to make the standards as practical as possible to realize the advantages associated
with schedule harmonization.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Integrating Technology in Pharmacy Practice</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Whether in the form of integrated health information networks, patient data systems or the
Internet, technology will have a profound impact on your practice. Your ability to become
technically efficient will be the determining factor in how successful you are in maintaining your
place in the marketplace. <BR>
<BR>
<P>Building on the success of the Pharmacy Claim Standard, CPhA is now working with all of the
key industry stakeholders on the development of appropriate modifications and revisions.  This
will be an important foundation for future initiatives relating to the development of pharmacy
software and methods of billing for cognitive services.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Practice Interest Networks</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>As part of our new  direction, CPhA is anxious to support the development of Practice Interest
Networks (PINs) in areas such as long-term care or diabetes. Many of these groups are active
throughout the country but few have evolved to the point of being organized nationally with
identifiable infrastructures.  We believe that PINs have much to offer the profession.  We also
recognize that many of these groups have special needs that CPhA is well positioned to help meet.
To better define the relationship between PINs and CPhA, a set of guiding principles, a possible
working model and list of benefits PINs may derive from their involvement was sent to
pharmacists identified as having an interest in a special practice area. We encourage you to
contact us if you are interested in participating in PINs.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>National Forum on Health</B>
<BR>
<P>CPhA continues to work in a collaborative fashion with members of the National Forum on
Health.  At the launch of the 1995 Pharmacy Awareness Week, the former federal health minister,
Diane Marleau, promised pharmacists would have a voice in ongoing plans of the Forum. <BR>
<BR> 
<HR> 
<B>Breastfeeding and Infant Nutrition</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>CPhA supports the vital role pharmacists play in promoting and supporting breastfeeding and
infant nutrition.  As a result, we have developed and released a position statement on this issue
that supports the World Health Organization's International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk
Substitutes.  The position clearly demonstrates to the public and health care professionals the role
you play in providing advice on this issue.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Responding to Regulatory Issues</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Providing responses on behalf of members to requests from the federal government on a variety of
issues relating to drugs and pharmacy practice is one of our regular services. Recent issues have
included schedule amendments including Rx to OTC switches, the DIN System update, line
extensions, nonmedicinal ingredients and the review of the Emergency Drug Release Program. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Recomm - A Challenge to Your Business Practice</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Many pharmacists signed contracts with Recomm International Display and were encouraged to
enter into leasing agreements to rent electronic message signs.  CPhA has monitored this situation
closely and has developed a checklist of questions you should ask yourselves before entering into
similar contracts with other providers.  We are also currently monitoring developments with other
associations which have been adversely affected by Recomm's filing for bankruptcy.<BR>

<HEAD><TITLE>Developing Your Practice</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>Developing Your Practice</H2>

<P>During this year of transition, we have listened to your needs and renewed our commitment to
developing strategies that allow you greater involvement in your association.  We are proud of the
many products and services we have developed for you. In these changing times, we must not
only fulfil our role as the national voice for pharmacists but also refocus our efforts to provide
practice tools that help you manage the realities of the profession.  Many of these tools are
available on our Fax-Info line service and are described in more detail in the Pharmacy 4U
catalogue. <P>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>New and Enhanced Products</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Therapeutic Choices, our newest reference tool, was designed with your needs as a busy health
care provider in mind. It is the most authoriative and up-to-date Canadian resource of treatment
options available to provide the best care for your patients. The publication has been
tremendously well received since its release in August 1995.  More than 9,100 copies have been
sold.  In response to your feedback and excellent published reviews, we are planning a second
edition for release in mid-1997.<BR>
<BR>
<P>The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS)  is your main drug information
resource. Available in print and on CD-ROM, it is considered by pharmacists and physicians to be
the most indispensable source of drug information.  This year's enhancements include general
monographs for corticosteroids and narcotic analgesics, a drugs in dentistry addition to the
Clin-Info section and tagging of all tables with product names for easy identification and retrieval.
As with the Compendium of Nonprescription Products, we continue to explore new ways to
adapt the text to technology and trends in pharmacy. <BR>
<BR>
<P>The new  Nonprescription Drug Reference for Health Professionals, formerly known as
Self-Medication, to be released in Spring 1996, will be more user friendly.  We are optimistic that
the new design and added features will strengthen its value for you.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Conferences, Workshops and Forums</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Each year, CPhA provides you with venues to discuss current issues and take part in workshops
that provide valuable tools to enhance your professional development.  In October, a workshop
was held to expand the role of pharmacy technicians and in  November, CPhA, in collaboration
with the Association of Faculties of Pharmacy of Canada hosted a workshop on pharmacy
practice research methods. <BR>
<BR>
<P>The 84th Annual Conference in May 1996 in Calgary is no exception. The 1996 conference
program reflects your valuable feedback on the need for a more compact program with hands- on
workshops and opportunities to voice your concerns about issues directly affecting you. Watch
for new conference features including full-day patient care workshops, more opportunities for
networking and a hands-on demonstration "Pharmacy and the Information Superhighway". <BR>



<BR>
<P>Over the past few years, the mandate of the Community Pharmacy Affairs Committee (CPAC)
has focused on economic and regulatory issues of concern to community pharmacists. With that in
mind, CPhA and CPAC held a practical forum in March 1996 in Moncton "Providing Leadership
in Drug Use Management". The forum, which had record attendance, provided helpful tips for
pharmacists seeking to partner with third-party payers, employer groups and government to
demonstrate their role in effectively controlling drug plan costs.  Workshops also provided initial
steps to be taken to practice pharmaceutical care.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Patient Education Tools</H3>
<BR>
<P>Greater patient education and communication are important to you.  CPhA continues to develop
materials to explain the valuable services you provide your patients.  During 1995- 96, a number 
of patient education materials have been added to our library.<BR>
<BR>

<P>The "Which Drug Should I Take?" leaflets are ideal for you to help your patients understand the
importance of appropriate medication use. The pads or loose leaf sheets provide a checklist of
questions on both prescription and nonprescription medication that patients should have answers
to before leaving the pharmacy.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Pharmacy Awareness Week (PAW)</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>The educational leaflet and children's colouring book developed for use during the 1995 Pharmacy
Awareness Week are great tools for you to teach adult and young patients alike about your
contribution to health care.  More tools are being planned for the 1996 PAW under the theme: 
Shared Care: You and Your Pharmacist.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Visible/Invisible Services</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>The material developed for you in response to the Public Service Health Care Plan choosing a
mail order service gives patients tangible reasons for visiting a community pharmacist. Use it to
educate your patients about the visible and invisible services you provide.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Coming Soon!</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>You won't want to miss the many practical tools we are currently developing including: 
<UL><LI> a training video and resource  manual developed with the Canadian Society of Hospital
<LI>     Pharmacists on sterile preparation for hospital and community pharmacists
     <LI>a booklet on the use of asthma devices
<LI>     clinical practice guidelines on barbiturate - containing analgesics and benzodiazepines
     <LI>developed with the Canadian Medical Association
 <LI>    a pocket reference on H2 receptor antagonists
 <LI>    a manual of tips on implementing pharmaceutical care
 <LI>    a homepage on the Internet for pharmacists involved in practice research to discuss the
  <LI>   development and evaluation of pharmaceutical care practice models 
   <LI>  easy-to-use media and advocacy  tool kits. </UL>

<P>CPhA will also be making available in the near future a decision aid on hormone replacement
therapy and will be endorsing a series of pharmacist clinic days. <BR>

<HEAD><TITLE>Communicating with our Members</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>Communicating with our Members</H2>

<P>Changing from a federation of associations to an organization of individual members means that
you now have a direct say in how CPhA tackles issues of national concern to pharmacy.  Now
more than ever, good communication with members is essential.  To that end, a number of new
services are available that not only provide you with accessible information on our activities but
also allow you to communicate more effectively with us.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Fax-Info Line</B>

<P>This easy-to-use 24 hour-a-day service launched on July 1, 1995 saves you valuable time and
energy searching for information on CPhA activities as well as patient and professional materials.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Just by making a single telephone call, you can select a needed document by following a series of
simple voice prompts.  Within minutes, a computer sends the information you requested by fax.<BR>
<BR>
<P>In the first six months, more than 3,000 documents have been faxed to pharmacists.  Information
is updated daily.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Impact</B>
<BR>
<P>Impact is the CPhA member's newsletter that gives you "at-a-glance" news on CPhA activities
and national and provincial pharmacy issues.  It is published seven times a year and is a forum for
CPhA member communications.<BR>
<BR>
<P>In 1996, a new feature has been added to Impact, The Insider, a four page insert profiling CPhA
membership activities, member successes, achievements and practice innovations. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>New Toll-free Ways to Reach Us </B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Most pharmacists are probably familiar with the value of a 1-800 number. We want to provide
you with every opportunity to contact us from anywhere in Canada. An effective voice mail
system and toll-free telephone and fax numbers have been put in place. We encourage you to call
us at 1-800-917- 9489 or fax us at 1-800-601-1904.  Both services are available to you at no cost.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Communicating Via the Net</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>In this burgeoning age of technology, the Internet has become an integral part of  business
communication activities.  Some of you probably use the global network to obtain current
pharmaceutical and health information or to communicate with your colleagues around the world. <BR>
<BR>
<P>CPhA is committed to being part of this diverse network of information. As a first step, you can
communicate with us via the Internet using our e-mail address cdnpharm@ftn.net.  <BR>
<BR>
<P>We will also be launching our official homepage on the Internet at our May 1996 conference in
Calgary.  Besides having access to information on the activities we have undertaken on your
behalf, you will also find health and professional information to assist you with your practice
needs.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>Campus Tours</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Keeping pharmacy students aware of CPhA activities is a key objective of the campus tours.  In
1995, CPhA President Bill Wilson and President-Elect Bev Allen spoke to more than 900 students
from all nine faculties of pharmacy.  More than 65 per cent of students in attendance heard for the
first time what their national association does for them. More than 300 students became CPhA
members this year.  As a result 50 per cent of pharmacy students in Canada are now CPhA
members! <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>CPhA Surveys</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Your input into CPhA's future direction is critical.  Throughout the year, we will be contacting
many of you to get your feedback as to what issues are important to you. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<B>New Membership Categories</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>We have developed new membership categories to provide incentives for you to be involved in
your national association. They include a graduating student fee which makes it easy to advance
from student to active member status in the first two years of practice and a corporate member
category for corporations supporting the association's objectives.  A new office computer system
called "Association Plus" has been put in place to better accommodate the new membership
structure.   <BR>

<BR>
</UL>
<B>2.3	Educational Activities</B><BR>

<UL>The process of professional education is never complete but is an integral aspect of being a responsible pharmacist.  However, continuing pharmacy education is expensive to develop and to implement.<BR>
<BR>
For the purpose of these guidelines, professional pharmacy educational programs can include the following events:  continuing education, both professional and business; pharmacy meetings or conferences.<BR>
<BR>
To be eligible for continuing education credits, programs must fall within CCCEP program approval guidelines.  <BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>2.3.1	Pharmacy Organized Educational Activities</B><BR>

			<UL>It is ethically acceptable for pharmaceutical manufacturers to financially support pharmacy continuing education programs that are organized by pharmacists provided:<BR>

<BR>
			c)	All educational programs must be objective and present a balanced point of view, regardless of the source of funding.<BR>

<BR>
<UL>	Occasionally, an individual pharmaceutical manufacturer will take the initiative and organize an educational program for a group of pharmacists.<BR>

<LI type=square>	 	It is expected that pharmacists will demonstrate the highest level of professional conduct when interacting with manufacturers' representatives.<BR>
</UL><BR><BR>
<BR>
<B>2.5	&nbsp;&nbsp; Gifts, Donations and Samples (Clinical Evaluation Packages)</B><BR>
<BR>

<H3>Mission of Pharmacy</H3>
<HR>
<P>The mission of pharmacy is to serve society as the profession responsible for the
optimal use of drugs.

<P>In this mission statement  optimal refers to safe, effective and economic
drug use, which appropriately meets the needs of the individual patients. 
Pharmacists fulfil this mission with the provision of pharmaceutical care:

<P><B>Definition of Pharmaceutical Care</B><BR>
<BR>Pharmaceutical care is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving
definite
outcomes that improve a patient's quality of life.  These outcomes are 1) cure of disease, 2)
elimination or
reduction of a patient's symptomatology, 3) arresting or slowing of a disease process, or 4)
preventing a
disease or symptomatology.

<P>Pharmaceutical care involves the process through which a pharmacist cooperates with a
patient and other
professionals in designing, implementing and monitoring a therapeutic plan that will produce
specific
therapeutic outcomes for the patient.  This in turn involves three major functions: 1) identifying
potential and
actual drug-related problems, 2) resolving actual drug-related problems, and 3) preventing
potential drug-related problems.<BR><BR>

<B>STEPS FOR  POLISHING  YOUR RESUME </B>
<P>
<B>Identifying Your Skills</B>
<P>
Conduct an honest and thorough assessment of yourself.  Identify
your skills and begin to develop general areas of career interest.

<OL><LI>Analyze your past accomplishments and experiences.  What skills
did you use <B>most often</B>, what skills did you <B>enjoy using</B>,
and which of your skills are <B>most marketable</B>.  Next take
into account what you learned about yourself from understanding
the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).  What are your preferences?
 What is your MBTI type?  What does this tell you about yourself
and your skills?  And finally, what have you learned about yourself
from: other self-assessment instruments, paper and pencil exercises,
and feedback from others?  Pull this together and you will have
identified most of your skills.
</OL><P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.   Perform The Accomplishments Exercise
<P>
<B>Targeting Your Resume </B>
<P>
You have done self-assessment.  You have gathered information
about various careers.  You have made some decisions about which
areas to pursue.  Now, you need to target your resume to those
areas of interest. 
<OL><LI>What skills should you highlight.  Well, if you have been
gathering information about careers in order to make an informed
decision you probably already have a pretty good idea what skills
are most appropriate to highlight.  If you haven't done your homework,
then here's what you need to do.
<LI>Use the Functional and Industry <I>CD&amp;P Resource Packets,
</I>available on reserve at CD&amp;P and for purchase at Campus
Copy, as starting points for understanding different industries
and functions.  These resource packets contain information about
a particular function or industry, job descriptions relevant to
that area, past <I>Summer Job Surveys, </I>and sample resumes
and coverletters appropriate to that function or industry. 
<LI>Utilize the many resources available in the CD&amp;P Resource
Center and Lippincott Library to help you better  understand your
targeted area of interest. 
<LI>Attend the Career Exploration Conference on October 5th and
6th and hear directly from professionals working in a variety
of functions and industries.
<LI>Identify people who work/worked in your targeted area of interest
through the: <I>The Wharton Class of 1998 Student Directory (Face
Book), </I>the face book will help you identify peers who previously
worked in your targeted area of interest.  <I>The</I> <I>Summer
Job Surveys and CD&amp;P Contact Lists</I>, both located at CD&amp;P
and both will help you identify current 2nd Years, who worked
over the summer in your targeted area of interest.  While the
<I>Alumni Contact List </I>at CD&amp;P will aid you in identifying
alumni who work in your targeted area of interest. By using these
resources to talk directly with people who have worked or are
working in your areas of interest you will hear the skills that
are necessary for success and thus be able to tailor your resume
accordingly.
<LI>Ask others to review your resume.  What themes are coming
through to the reader?  Are these the themes which you are trying
to highlight?  
</OL><P>
<B>Formatting &amp; Style</B>
<P>
<OL><LI>Take about 30-45 minutes to review resumes in the <I>Wharton
Resume Book</I> (located in the CD&amp;P Library), or you can
access the 2nd Year Resume Book for the Class of 1997 via the
CD&amp;P/OCRS icon on the computer labs in Vance and Steinberg-Dietrich
Halls.  Looking at these resumes can help you decide on a style
and format which will best emphasize the strengths in your background
and experience.  Also, going through the resume books can also
help you identify appropriate alumni to contact.
<LI>Browse through the "How to Write a Resume" books
located in the Career Resource Center, under Career Management
Resources.
</OL><P>
<B>Opportunities To Have Your Resume Critiqued</B>
<P>
Developing an effective resume is a process.  Your primary resource
for a resume critique should be an individual with experience
in your field of interest.  Please ask 2nd year MBAs to give you
feedback on your resume, they can be one of the most effective
sources of advice and information.  Keep in mind that the resume
is an ever-changing document which will be revised as things in
your life change.  Don't try to develop a "perfect"
resume, but rather one that makes sense in light of your present
situation, past experience, and future goals.
<OL><LI>Sign-up for WGA and CD&amp;P club sponsored events usually
held in October and early November.  Watch your mail folders and
<I>The Wharton Journal</I> for more information about where and
when to sign-up.
<LI>Contact a fellow first or second year student via the <I>Contact
Lists</I>, <I>Face Book</I> or <I>Resume Books</I>, who has industry
or functional experience in your area of interest.
<LI>When conducting information interviews, ask the person you
are speaking with what type of skills and experience they look
for in a resume.  Ask specifically for feedback on your resume.
<LI>CD&amp;P counselors are available for very specific and quick resume

questions during our regularly scheduled "Quick Questions"
Monday to Friday from 12:00noon to 1:00p.m. and 4:00p.m. to 5:00p.m.

<LI>Consult with family members, friends and past employers/colleagues
who have related experience that you are interested in pursuing
and good insight into your past.
<LI>Get as much feedback as possible on your resume, but remember everyone
will have an opinion and advice.  Take their feedback
into consideration and then make your own decision.
</OL><P>
<B>FURTHER  ANALYSIS  OF  THE  BASIC  SKILL  AREAS</B>
<P>
I.  TRANSFERABLE SKILLS.  <U><B>CAREER CHANGERS TAKE NOTE</B></U><B>:


 </B>Identifying, articulating and then marketing your <U>transferable</U>
skills are the main ingredients to a successful career change.
 First, you must know what your skill set is and how to articulate
it.  Second, you must know what your prospective employer needs.
 Finally, you must demonstrate how a particular skill you have
used effectively in the past is the same basic skill the employer
has indicated a need for.
<P>
Below are six major areas skills fall into, under each major heading
are statements that help articulate what it means to have that
particular skill.  Read each of these carefully and begin to plan
how you will shape your past experiences into a bridge that brings
you into your next career. This is a good exercise now as you
begin to develop your resume and later when you write your cover
letters and prepare for interviewing.

<B>THE WHARTON RESUME BOOK</B>
<P>
<B>What is The Wharton Resume Book?</B>
<P>
The Wharton Resume Book is a collection of the resumes of the
students in your class made available to recruiters in hard copy
and electronic form.  The hard copy version of the resume book
is a box of alphabetically organized resumes accompanied by an
index.  The index includes references which assist recruiters
in understanding students' interests, skills and backgrounds.
 The indices include information on your:  
<UL><LI>Areas of Career Interest
<LI>Language Proficiency
<LI>Type of Wharton Degree
<LI>Country of Work Authorization
</UL><P>
The electronic version of the resume book, sent along with each
hard copy, allows recruiters to conduct comprehensive database
searches from the resume book and index information.  Using this
tool, recruiters may identify students by using any or a combination
of the following criteria: 
<UL><LI>Functional Area of Career Interest
<LI>Undergraduate Concentration
<LI>Non-MBA Graduate Degrees
<LI>Type of Wharton Degree Program
<LI>Wharton MBA Major
<LI>Language Proficiency
<LI>Previous Work Function
<LI>Previous Work Industry
<LI>Previous Work Location
<LI>Country of Work Authorization
</UL><P>
  Recruiters can also search the resume database by using a <B>Key
Word Search</B> capability.  Recruiters can view resumes on screen,
print resumes, fax resumes to another office, keep a notation
file on each student and develop mailmerges all directly from
the electronic resume book. Last year, the First Year Wharton
Resume Book was ordered by 211 companies and the Second Year book
by 332 companies.
<P>
The Information gathered  for the resume book is also used to
conduct electronic searches for employers who contact CD&amp;P
with specific employment needs ( Resume Referral Service).  Last
year CD&amp;P sent 1,500 Wharton resumes through this service.
<P>
<B>How To Be Included In The Wharton Resume Book</B>
<P>
Any Wharton MBA student is eligible to be included in the Wharton
Resume Book for his or her class.  In order to be included you
need to take the following steps and <B>must </B>do so within
the stated deadlines.       
<OL><LI>Download the Resume Creation/Index Program from the Wharton
Computing Labs 
<LI>Create your resume and enter your index information using
the Resume Creation/Index Program
<LI>Use the multiple opportunities available to you to have your
resume reviewed by  peers, recruiters and/or CD&amp;P
<LI>Sign and return the resume/index data release form to CD&amp;P
by Thursday, November 7th
<LI>Submit your resume and index information via the Wharton computing
labs by the deadline of Friday, November 8th at 5:00 PM
</OL><P>
<B>Resume Creation/Index Program</B>
<P>
The Resume Creation/Index Program is a database program into which
you will enter information about your background, skills and interests
along with your resume. This information is then used to produce
both the hard copy  and electronic version of the resume book.
  The Resume Creation/Index Program is a menu-driven, windows-based,
user friendly program which you can download from Wharton Computing
Labs and use on your home computer.  The program contains help
screens which will aid you in using it.  If you feel you need
more guidance, detailed documentation is available on the CD&amp;P/OCRS
home page or you can obtain a hard-copy at CD&amp;P.  You will
receive instructions on downloading and uploading the Resume Creation/Index


Program through your mailfolders and your e-mail accounts.
<P>
<I><B>Index  Portion of the Program</B></I>
<P>
The Index Program, from which the hard copy indices and the electronic
search program are created, is a series of screens on which you
describe your future interests, past experience and language skill
set.  You do this by choosing from a defined set of choices. 
In some cases, you may not be able to perfectly match your previous
experience or future interests with the choices available in the
index program.   The available choices for index selection are
designed to facilitate recruiters' searches of the resume database
system.  They are not intended to be exhaustive or to precisely
mirror the specific background of each student.   The end-user
of the resume book is the Wharton recruiter; we have designed
the book and it's search capabilities based on their needs and
feedback.  The more universal the electronic search criteria are,
the more likely it is that your name will appear in a recruiter's
search results.  Please choose the categories that best match
your education, experience and interests. If you have difficulty
deciding in what category your background best fits, a CD&amp;P
counselor can assist you.
<P>
<I><B>Resume Creation  Portion of the Program</B></I>
<P>
Through the Resume Creation Program you will create a resume which
will be used in the Wharton Resume Book, both printed and electronic
formats, and the OCRS day-of-interview packets. The resume book
is produced for use by our recruiters and the Resume Creation
Software was developed to create the best product for them and
provide the greatest number of recruiters with access to the resume
book.  The electronic resume book and it's search capabilities
can be used by any recruiter with minimum computer equipment and
is not dependent on a specific word processing package.  Therefore,
the resume creation software is not a word processor and does
not have all the capabilities of one.<B>  </B>The software provides
you with numerous options to format and structure your resume
but be prepared to be flexible - there are some things the software
just can't do.
<P>
After you enter data into the index portion of the program, you
will create your resume using a series of text boxes and menu
driven options. You may create your resume in the resume creation
software any way that you like.  The only requirement is that
the resume be one page in length - the resume creation program
will notify you if your resume goes beyond one page.
<P>
The Resume Creation/Index Program was developed with several advantages
for you:
<UL><LI>You can fax your resume directly from the program (if you
have fax modem capabilities)
<LI>You can update the electronic copy of your resume that is
housed at OCRS for the recruiter's day-of interview packets
</UL><UL><LI>You can cut &amp; Paste text (not format) for the program
into a number of word processing packages
</UL><P>
<B>Resume Index/Creation Data Release Form</B>
<P>
In order to release the information on your resume to recruiters
in printed and electronic form, we must have a signed release
from you on file.  This release will be put in your mailfolder
well in advance of the <B>Thursday, November 7th deadline.</B>
 YOU CAN NOT BE IN THE RESUME BOOK UNLESS WE HAVE YOUR SIGNED
RELEASE FORM.
<P>
<B>Submitting Your Resume And Index Data</B>
<P>
The Resume Creation/Index Program has been created to allow you
to download the program and work on it from home.  You will submit
your resume and index data by saving the information you have
entered into the program at home to a diskette and then submitting
it in a quick, easy step via the Wharton Computing Labs.  If you
do not have a computer at home, you will be able to work on the
Resume Creation/Index Program from the Wharton Computing Labs
by utilizing a network version and saving your work on diskette.
 You will receive detailed instructions on submitting your resume
and index data through your mailfolders and your e-mail accounts.

from: other self-assessment instruments, paper and pencil exercises,
and feedback from others?  Pull this together and you will have
identified most of your skills.

</OL><P>
<B>Targeting Your Resume </B>
<P>
You have done self-assessment.  You have gathered information
about various careers.  You have made some decisions about which
areas to pursue.  Now, you need to target your resume to those
areas of interest. 
<OL><LI>What skills should you highlight.  Well, if you have been
gathering information about careers in order to make an informed
decision you probably already have a pretty good idea what skills
are most appropriate to highlight.  If you haven't done your homework,
then here's what you need to do.
<LI>Use the Functional and Industry <I>CD&amp;P Resource Packets,
</I>available on reserve at CD&amp;P and for purchase at Campus
Copy, as starting points for understanding different industries
and functions.  These resource packets contain information about
a particular function or industry, job descriptions relevant to
that area, past <I>Summer Job Surveys, </I>and sample resumes
and coverletters appropriate to that function or industry. 
<LI>Utilize the many resources available in the CD&amp;P Resource
Center and Lippincott Library to help you better  understand your
targeted area of interest. 
<LI>Attend the Career Exploration Conference on October 5th and
6th and hear directly from professionals working in a variety
of functions and industries.
<LI>Identify people who work/worked in your targeted area of interest
through the: <I>The Wharton Class of 1998 Student Directory (Face
Book), </I>the face book will help you identify peers who previously
worked in your targeted area of interest.  <I>The</I> <I>Summer
Job Surveys and CD&amp;P Contact Lists</I>, both located at CD&amp;P
and both will help you identify current 2nd Years, who worked
over the summer in your targeted area of interest.  While the
<I>Alumni Contact List </I>at CD&amp;P will aid you in identifying
alumni who work in your targeted area of interest. By using these
resources to talk directly with people who have worked or are
working in your areas of interest you will hear the skills that
are necessary for success and thus be able to tailor your resume
accordingly.
<LI>Ask others to review your resume.  What themes are coming
through to the reader?  Are these the themes which you are trying
to highlight?  
</OL><P>
<B>Formatting &amp; Style</B>
<OL><LI>Purchase the <I>Self-Presentation Resource Packet</I> at Campus
Copy (3907 Walnut Street).  This resource packet gives detailed
information on preparing resumes and cover letters, as well as,
interview preparation.  A reserve copy is available at the front
desk of CD&amp;P.
<LI>Take about 30-45 minutes to review resumes in the <I>Wharton
Resume Book</I> (located in the CD&amp;P Library), or you can
access the 2nd Year Resume Book for the Class of 1997 via the
CD&amp;P/OCRS icon on the computer labs in Vance and Steinberg-Dietrich
Halls.  Looking at these resumes can help you decide on a style
and format which will best emphasize the strengths in your background
and experience.  Also, going through the resume books can also
help you identify appropriate alumni to contact.
<LI>Browse through the "How to Write a Resume" books
located in the Career Resource Center, under Career Management
Resources.
<LI>See the <I>CD&amp;P/OCRS Resume Requirements Checklist </I>to
ensure that your resume meets all the requirements for inclusion
in the Wharton MBA Class of 1997 Print &amp; Electronic Resume
Books.  Last year approximately 200 resume books were sent to
companies interested in recruiting 1st Year Wharton MBAs, and
over 800 individual resumes were sent to companies via CD&amp;P's
Rapid Resume Services.
</OL><P>
<B>Opportunities To Have Your Resume Critiqued</B>
<P>
Developing an effective resume is a process.  Your primary resource
for a resume critique should be an individual with experience
in your field of interest.  Please ask 2nd year MBAs to give you
feedback on your resume, they can be one of the most effective
sources of advice and information.  Keep in mind that the resume
is an ever-changing document which will be revised as things in
your life change.  Don't try to develop a "perfect"
resume, but rather one that makes sense in light of your present
situation, past experience, and future goals.
<OL><LI>Sign-up for WGA and CD&amp;P club sponsored events usually
held in October and early November.  Watch your mail folders and
<I>The Wharton Journal</I> for more information about where and
when to sign-up.

Lists</I>, <I>Face Book</I> or <I>Resume Books</I>, who has industry
or functional experience in your area of interest.
<LI>When conducting information interviews, ask the person you
are speaking with what type of skills and experience they look
for in a resume.  Ask specifically for feedback on your resume.
<LI>CD&amp;P counselors are available for very specific and quick
resume questions during our regularly scheduled "Quick Questions"
Monday to Friday from 12:00noon to 1:00p.m. and 4:00p.m. to 5:00p.m.
 Counseling sessions will be available for first year students
as of October 19th.
<LI>Consult with family members, friends and past employers/colleagues
who have related experience that you are interested in pursuing
and good insight into your past.
<LI>Get as much feedback as possible on your resume, but remember

everyone will have an opinion and advice.  Take their feedback
into consideration and then make your own decision.

<TITLE>INSIDE IMPACT - December 1996</TITLE>
<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>INSIDE IMPACT</H2>
<BODY>
<I>Highlights from the December issue of Impact, the membership newsletter of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association.</I>

<H4>W5 DELIVERS TIMELY REMINDER</H4>
If you're receiving rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers, now is a good time to review how
you declare them. CTV's current affairs program, W5, delivered the reminder in blunt fashion with
a recent story on income tax evasion. The piece focused on several incidents in southern Ontario
where pharmacists had failed to declare rebates, both monetary and product incentives, to
Revenue Canada. In addition, CTV highlighted the fact that many provinces require pharmacists
to pass on those rebates to their customers. Most pharmacists provide high quality care, CPhA
responded, but reminded members to review the association's code of ethics. 

<H4>COFFEE KEEPS 'EM TALKING</H4>
Pharmacist Wen Wong ensured Pharmacy Awareness Week was a success by serving up the best 
coffee in town. Scotts Pharmacy in the British Columbia town of Princeton used the annual event
to highlight its recent membership in Health Outcome Pharmacies and its specialized diabetes
care, and it had customers talking about the wonderful coffee, and the service, for weeks after.

<H4>CPhA GETS NEW NAME?</H4>
The acronym will remain the same, but CPhA could stand for the Canadian Pharmacists
Association if members approve the new name during the association's annual general meeting in
May. The board of directors recently  gave the go-ahead to change the name to the Canadian
Pharmacists Association, which more accurately reflects the current mission and makeup of the
association.
 
<H4>CLAIM STANDARD GETS PUMPED UP</H4>
Version 04 of the Pharmacy Claim Standard will be out within the next year following a thorough
review by a wide array of stakeholders. The standard, which will be renamed the Pharmacy
Electronic Communications Standard, or PECS for short, has undergone substantial changes to
improve claims adjudication, administration and on-line communication. 

<H4>ASSESSING PHARMACISTS' STRATEGIES</H4>
Over 50 pharmacies in southern Ontario have participated in a study to assess disease
management strategies developed by pharmacists. CPhA, which is conducting the study under
Merck Frosst's Vital Interests program, recently completed the first phase with some 800 patients
and is now doing interviews with many of those patients to determine the program's impact on
patient compliance and maintenance of drug therapy. Full results are expected in early 1997. 

<H4>CAMPUS TOUR '96</H4>
You can't get a better bang for your buck than a CPhA student membership. That's the message
president-elect Tom Healy delivered to hundreds of pharmacy students during Campus Tour '96.
With students now the second largest membership category, Healy believes they have a powerful
voice in CPhA.

<B> THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS EXERCISE</B>
<P>
<B> A Basis for Skills Assessment</B>
<P>
A primary focus of this section is identifying, understanding
and discussing your accomplishments.  Also this section of the
course pack will address broader issues and will point you to
multiple resources to further analyze some of these broader issues.
 Identifying and understanding accomplishments is one of the exercises
which can be done in a large class setting.  Further analysis
is encouraged and most appropriate in an individual or one-to-one
session.
<P>
Understanding and identifying accomplishments serves as an important
starting block for self analysis.  If you have a handle on a dozen
or so accomplishments, then you are better equipped to write a
resume draft (which is due in Session 3, November 3rd, of this
module), know what to highlight in a cover letter and what to
discuss in an interview.  In the next few weeks, carve out some
time to continue identifying, analyzing and re-analyzing a series
of accomplishments.  Come to the point that you can talk about
these without self-aggrandizing, but comfortably, as you would
talk about any historical situation.
<P>
<B>A. List significant accomplishments in your life (try 10).</B>
 These do not have to be work related.   They need not be significant
to anyone but you.  They do need to meet two criteria:
<P>
 1. You enjoyed <U><B>both</B></U> the results of the accomplishment
and the process of making the accomplishment happen.
<P>
 2. You did it well.
<P>
<B>B. Examine this list and answer the following questions:</B>
<P>
 1. Which key skills did you use to reach this goal? (Refer to
the Skills Inventory on the next page.)
<P>
 2. What did you enjoy most about this accomplishment?
<P>
 3. What enabled you to achieve these accomplishments -- your
skills, personality, drive, values, interests?
<P>
<B>C. Look for patterns in these accomplishments.</B>  Are the
same values, interests, skills reflected throughout?  Are these
the skills that you enjoy the most?
<P>
<B>D. Create a separate list of skills.  Prioritize these into
3 groups.</B>
<P>
 1. Enjoy these skills and must use them to feel like I'm accomplishing
something.
<P>
 2. Enjoy these skills and it would be nice to use them occasionally.
<P>
 3. Do not enjoy using these skills, diminish their importance
in my next job. 
<P>
<B>E. CAREER CHANGERS:  Treat your understanding, the communication
and the application of the skill/accomplishments as a foreign
language.</B>
<P>
 1. The term "analysis" for an investment banker, consultant,
brand manager, small business owner, musician, C.P.A., and engineer
have very different meanings.  Most often the basic skill of analysis
is transferable from one field to another.  
<P>
 2. The next set of questions is to analyze the context in which
you used the skill, the rewards associated with the use of the
skill.
<P>
 3. From the information about a field of interest, do <U><B>you</B></U>
believe you could effectively use the skill in another setting?
 Are you convinced that you would enjoy and be satisfied with
the type of accomplishments that result from the use of that skill?
<P>
<B>Significance</B>:  The list of most preferred skills, and the
common values and motivations identified in this exercise create
a priority list of things you want in your next job.  This exercise
can aid in preparation of resume, interviewing and job search
campaign.  By identifying your needs, better able to enter the
marketplace and identify:
<P>
 1. What you find interesting (or not interesting) about a career
area.
<P>
 2. Questions you need to have answered to make career decisions.

<TITLE>INSIDE IMPACT - November 1996</TITLE>
<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>INSIDE IMPACT</H2>
<BODY>
<I>Highlights from the November issue of Impact, the membership newsletter of the Canadian
Pharmaceutical Association.</I>

<H4>TURNING UP THE HEAT</H4>
Health care organizations want the federal government to pass tough antitobacco legislation
before the next election. Over 130 groups and associations from across the country sponsored
double-page advertisements in the Globe and Mail and La Presse criticizing the government's
record on tobacco control and urged Prime Minister Jean Chretien to take action. CPhA's
involvement met with approval from many, including Jim Semchism, a pharmacist who
spearheaded legislation banning the sale of tobacco products in Ontario pharmacies. <BR>

<H4>TIMING KEY TO SUCCESS FOR RX CANADA</H4>
Financial resources, commitment and timing should ensure the success of Rx Canada, CPhA's
executive director says. Leroy Fevang predicts the new network of chain and independent
pharmacies will survive where others have failed because of its deep pockets, a strong
commitment from its members and changes in the health care system.  <BR>

<H4>SETTLING SIZE, SHAPE AND COLOR</H4>
A federal appeals court has lifted an injunction barring three generic drug manufacturers from
copying the size, shape and color of Eli Lilly's antidepressant Prozac and that has refuelled the
ongoing debate over look-alike pills. Health Canada is preparing a draft position but officials with
the Drugs Directorate admit they are looking to the courts to help resolve this issue.<BR>

<H4>DEFUSING THE PATENT DEBATE</H4>
A good pharmacist can go a long way to containing the rising costs of prescription medication. In
a presentation to the Consumers Association of Canada, Garry Cruickshank advised Canadians to
choose a pharmacist who meets the level of service they expect. The chairman of the National
Pharmacy Coalition on Managed Care was part of a panel discussion on Bill C-91, the federal
legislation governing patent protection. He suggested consumers could defuse some of the tension
surrounding the issue by becoming more knowledgable of their medication use.<BR>  

<H4>NBPhA SERVES LEGAL NOTICE</H4>
The New Brunswick Pharmacy Association has served the government notice that it might
proceed with legal action over a recent decision to eliminate the 7% markup on prescriptions
dispensed through the provincial drug plan. Though NBPhA and the province have been without a
contract since October 1995, there have been a number of unilateral changes to the plan, including
cuts on the markup and changes to the professional fee.<BR> 

<H4>MEMBER DRIVE ON THE RIGHT ROAD</H4>
CPhA's drive to retain members in Alberta, Nova Scotia and Manitoba is only a few months old,
but to date there has been a healthy response. This summer, all three provinces switched from
mandatory to voluntary membership in the national association. So far over 1,000 pharmacists
have renewed their membership.

are statements that help articulate what it means to have that
particular skill. Read each of these carefully and begin to plan

<I>Highlights from the November issue of the Insider, a forum to energize your thinking, enhance
your practice and share your ideas, successes and innovative programs.</I>
<br>
<H4>Campus Tour returns</H4>

Campus Tour '96 began its trek across Canada last month with stops at the universities of
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The annual tour has become a way for students to meet with
CPhA's president and raise issues concerning them. It has also become a way for the association
to gauge how effectively it is reaching students and whether it is meeting their expectations. The
proof of Campus Tour's success is in the numbers: last year about 350 became members and
CPhA now has over 1,400, almost 45% of all pharmacy students in Canada.<BR>

<H4>Project to prove pharmacists' value</H4>

A managed care project in Nova Scotia is bringing all the players to the table -- employers, drug
plan administrators, insurers and pharmacists -- in a group effort to improve the employer's drug
benefit plan and the health of its employees. Pharmacists representing each of the stores most
frequented by employees are part of a team that will examine the employer's drug plan and
identify areas that can be improved and ways to possibly save money. The Pharmacy Association
of Nova Scotia hopes to eventually have a package of managed care strategies that pharmacists
can tailor to the individual needs of employers. 
<BR>
<H4>Golf or pharmacy?</H4>

Fame comes in strange ways. For Jason Zuback, a pharmacist from Drayton Valley, Alberta, it
came in the form of a 351-yard drive down the first fairway of the Las Vegas Hilton Country
Club. The massive golf swing landed Zuback the RE/MAX North American long drive
championship and $35,000 cheque. Zuback, 26, is now faced with an interesting dilemma: a
career as a professional golfer or a pharmacist?<BR>

<H4>New fee a hit</H4>

CPhA's latest benefit is a hit with recent university graduates. To make the transition from
university to the first years of pharmacy practice a little lighter on your wallet, CPhA has
introduced a staggered membership fee: you pay 1/3 of the full membership fee in your first year,
2/3 in your second and full membership dues in your third. Already 280 of the 600 students who
graduated this spring have taken advantage.
<BR>
<H4>Touring the net</H4>

Our list of reader-recommended websites continues to grow. This issue, members suggested tours
to pharmacy's yellow pages, set up by the American Society of Health Systems; the editorial pages
of Pharmacy Practice, Pharmacy Post and Hospital Pharmacy Practice, and Health Canada's site
on medication and alcohol use by seniors.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Effectively Interacting with Wharton Alumni Network
</H2></H2><H3 ALIGN=Center><HR>Bruce Friedman WG'73
</H3><H3 ALIGN=Center>President, Wharton Club of Southern California
</H3><P>
The alumni network, when approached properly, can be an invaluable
resource for the soon-to-graduate, job-hunting student.  The critical
issue, of course, is to determine the proper approach.  As president
(since 1988) of the Wharton club of Southern California, I have
received calls from approximately 250 graduating students who
were undertaking West Coast job searches.  Accordingly, it came
as no surprise when I was asked to provide an analysis of this
process from the perspective of an alumnus.  However, having spent
so much time with students, I would prefer not to be quite so
restrictive, but rather interweave my thoughts on the alumni perspective
into an overview of the utilization of the alumni network in the
job search and career development process.
<P>
The first point I wish to stress might seem to be an obvious one,
but in my experience, it is one upon which most students never
focus.  To be most effective in the subject endeavor, you must
reach those alums who have the inclination to be helpful in this
process.  One personal introduction from a well-connected alum
is easily worth a dozen casual references from the deep recesses
of another's rolodex.  Fortunately, among our 58,000 Wharton alumni,
there are many who are only too happy to provide as much assistance
as their schedule will permit.  On the other hand, there are also
many who will never respond to anyone's telephone call or letter.
 The great majority, however, will respond once or twice per year,
but only if a student makes an extremely compelling case.  How
then might one determine who is likely to be most helpful?  The
best resource is the Wharton Alumni Club in the geographic area
of your choice.  One of the club officers should be able to provide
you with referrals to active club members in your chosen industry
or functional area.  (The WHG Alumni Search database is now available
on campus through the local network or on the CD&amp;P Home Page.)
<P>
This brings us to the critical nature of the timing of the initial
contact with alumni.  This clearly should be done as early as
possible, and in the ideal case, the forward-thinking student
will begin to cultivate the alumni network no later than the date
of his/her admission to The Wharton School.  Many alums will be
delighted to provide guidance at this time to students about to
embark upon a Wharton education.  It is a comfortable experience
for the alum.  There is absolutely no pressure on him to perform.
 The smart student should then attempt to maintain and expand
upon these contacts during the course of his education, so that
upon commencement of a formal job search, there will be a number
of alums who know, respect and are willing to go to bat for him.
 In a job market as difficult as the current one, having someone
make that personal recommendation is often the difference between
being gainfully employed and having yet one more rejection letter
to hang on your wall.  And please remember, no matter how bright
and charming you are, it's unlikely that anyone will make that
strong personal recommendation if you are known merely as a voice
over the telephone or as one among many impeccably prepared resumes.
<P>
Since most of you probably have not yet established alumni contacts,
you now have something to move to the top of your priority list.
 In addition to the aforementioned strategies for selecting prospective
contacts, one of the most effective means to meet alumni is to
attend Alumni Club functions during the winter, spring and summer
breaks.  In fact, common sense dictates that it is far better
to make that initial contact in person at a social gathering than
in an impersonal telephone call or letter in which you are asking
for assistance.  In Southern California, we always schedule events
to coincide with these breaks, and we publicize them through the
Alumni Affairs office and The Wharton Journal.  Yet, I am always
amazed and somewhat disappointed at how few students take advantage
of this opportunity.  To make matters worse, those who do attend
often congregate among themselves!  What a tremendous waste, especially
when you consider that as soon as they return to campus, some
of those students might be sending unsolicited letters, asking
for help from the very same alums who were standing right beside
them at the reception.  The power of personal contact, especially
at an alumni event, should never be underestimated.  Remember
that The Golden Rule of Networking states that you are most effective
when you are not in desperate need of help.  Establish your contacts
when you have something to offer, even if it's merely an observation
on the current goings-on at The Wharton School.
<P>
For those of you who, for one reason or another, will be unable
to make that initial contact in person, what then is the proper
way to contact your carefully selected Wharton alum?  CD&amp;P
has provided excellent guidelines for the graduating student.
 The major weakness, however, of the recommended approach, is
that everybody follows it to the letter.  Therefore, for those
of us who, year after year, seem to be on every student's list,
it becomes rather difficult to get excited about one more student
making the identical pitch in the identical fashion.  You must
develop a means to differentiate yourself from the crowd, while,
of course remaining within the guidelines for politeness, preparedness,
etc.  As an example of what I consider to be a shocking lack of
forethought and originality, consider that of all the students
who have ever contacted me from Philadelphia requesting an opportunity
to meet when they arrive in Southern California, NOT ONE has ever
inquired if there was anything he could do to help our Alumni
Club while in Los Angeles.  The administrative work to be performed
for a 650 member organization is considerable.  One would think
that one Wharton student might have realized this is a perfect
occasion to make one's self known to alumni leaders as an individual
who is willing to put something back into the system from which
he hopes to extract aid and guidance.  Try it!  I'm sure my fellow
club presidents will be most surprised and grateful.  And don't
forget to ask the alum you are soliciting for help if there is
anything you might do for him on campus.  It might be something
as simple as passing on a message to one of your professors who
was a favorite of his, but still, it is a means to differentiate
yourself from the crowd and perhaps provide a reason for a follow-up
call.
<P>
In closing, I wish to emphasize that many of these principles
will be just as important when you undertake your search for your
second or third job post-graduation.  You are now expending an
enormous amount of time, energy and money to obtain your Wharton
degree.  Cultivate the alumni network early and realize a payback
for the rest of your life.

<P>H<EM>ighlights from the August issue of the Insider, a forum to energize your thinking, enhance
your practice and share your ideas, successes and innovative programs.</EM><BR>
<BR><BR>
<P><STRONG>Clicking into the future</STRONG>
<P>Imagine a complete patient profile at your finger tips: not just the current information, but past and
family history, complete with your notes about the patient's condition at the time each drug was
dispensed. Or therapeutic care plans that allow you and your patient to set goals, mark your progress
and arrange future appointments. Or a feature that, if you detect a drug-related problem, lets you write
a brief note to the physician -- all with the click of a mouse. Meet to Simplicity Plus, the latest in
pharmaceutical care software.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Live from BC, it's the pharmacy show</STRONG>
<P>The British Columbia Pharmacy Association has found an innovative way of spreading its message:
radio. Earlier this year, BCPhA was offered a monthly segment on The Doctor Is In, a weekly
program on Vancouver-based AM 1040. In a few short months, the noon-hour, question-and-answer
pharmacy segment has grown so popular that communications director turned radio programmer July
Schlacter is contemplating a weekly show. Live radio may have its unpredictable side, but it attracts a
wide audience.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>A twist on marketing </STRONG>
<P>Marketing is the buzz word among pharmacy students at the University of Saskatchewan. When
several students agreed to participate in a two-day buying show, their initial plan was to display some of
the products and programs they had developed over the past year. They soon found themselves
rejecting offers to sell the products and the program ideas. "They weren't for sale," said fourth-year
student Chris Jacobs, "but we're going to explore the option." <BR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Nonprescription bookends</STRONG>
<P>Two books to assist you with patient counselling came off the press in August. The Nonprescription
Drug Reference for Health Professionals, formerly Self-Medication, is your answer to questions on
most common health concerns. The updated Compendium of Nonprescription Products is one of the
best sources for information on nonprescription products .<BR>


<BR><BR>


<STRONG>Reader response</STRONG>
<P>How are you handling alternative medications? Bill and Margo Ward of Didsbury, Alberta have some
suggestions for pharmacists making their first foray into homeopathic and herbal products. By
maintaining a "very complete library," they are providing counselling to their patients -- whether or not
those patients have purchased herbal medications at their pharmacy or from a health food store. That's
earned them a great deal of patient confidence.<BR>

<B>Suggestions for an Effective Cover Letter from a Seasoned Corporate
Recruiter</B> 

<P>
Despite the fact that I have seen some good cover letters that
were lengthy, I am a firm believer that shorter is better. I find
that cover letters are effective when candidates discuss the following:

1. Characteristics specific to our firm (i.e., firm strategy,
relationship vs. project consulting, results orientation, team
approach).
<P>

2. Experiences, either employment or education related, which
have prepared them for a career in this industry. Examples of
what types of projects they have worked on which are similar to
what people do in this industry. It is fine to give actual examples
of results- "increased a plant's productivity by "x"
percent in "x" amount of time."


<P>3. If a candidate has an unusual background (spent time in the performing arts or lived on a dig in a foreign country) the cover
letter is the appropriate place to explain the transition into
a business position. An employer cannot be expected to guess why
someone is interested in his/her company.
<P>


4. The obvious things to look out for in letters are spelling
errors and incorrect mail merges. An application loses something
when the student addresses it to me at XYZ and proceeds to tell
me how badly he/she wants to work at ABC company.

<P>

<P>Dear Mr. Control:

<P>
<B>Opening Paragraph:</B> The first paragraph should be a short
(two-four sentences) introduction to you. You should identify
that you are a Wharton student and indicate why you are writing
(i.e. for what division, for what position.) It is best to try
to be specific in this section so that the recruiter will know
how to treat your application. Simply saying you are interested
in working for Walt Disney, for example, doesn't give the recruiter
much to go on considering the large number of divisions and positions
at the firm. If you became interested in the firm after attending
their on-campus presentation you should mention that here. This
paragraph is also the appropriate and ideal time to mention that
your interest was peaked by a recent article you read or that
you have been referred by another person.

<P>
<B>Middle Paragraph: </B>The middle paragraph (sometimes -- but
only with discretion-- two paragraphs) is the meat of a cover
letter. This is the section in which you sell yourself and where
you link your past experiences to your future performance. It
is important to not simply repeat the information that you have
on your resume, but to synthesize the information and introduce
experiences and skills which make you qualified for the particular
job for which you are applying. Sometimes this means going into
detail about projects which gave you applicable experience but
are not detailed enough on your resume to make that clear. This
is also the section in which you should explain your particular
in the firm.

<P>
<B>Conclusion:</B> This part of the letter usually reiterates
your interest in the firm and indicates the action you are expecting
or that the recruiter should expect. If you are truly interested
in a position, you should never "leave the ball in their
court." End the letter thanking the recruiter for his or
her consideration and indicate that you will call in a few days
to discuss employment opportunities. If you are seeking employment
in a location where you plan to be over break, make sure you mention
this here.

<B>TIPS ON MANAGING THE WRITE-IN </B>

<P>
<B>COVER LETTER PROCESS</B> 

<P>
Wondering how you are going to meet the cover letter write-in
deadlines for all those great companies coming to campus next
semester? Wondering if you can manage the write-in process and
finals too? Here are some of tips brought to you by OCRS and CD&amp;P
to help you through:

<P>
1.<B> GET A COPY OF THE WRITE-IN LISTS</B>. Pick up a copy of
the write-in list and job description packets for Periods 8 -11.
These are the periods for which you have cover letter deadlines
in December and while you are on break. The packet for Period
8 will be available on November 22, the packet for Periods 9 -
11 on December 13th . This will allow you to work on the cover
letters from home. Keep in mind, however, that once these packets
are printed they are not updated. You can access the write-in
lists and interview schedules through the Placement System, which
is updated daily. Use the "Print Screen" command to
print out pages from the Placement System.

<P>
2.<B> REMEMBER, WRITE-IN DEADLINES ARE SUGGESTED DEADLINES</B>.
For the most part, the write-in deadlines are suggested deadlines.
It is important that you pay attention to these dates BUT realize
that they are manufactured based on when the companies <B>must</B>
have their invitation lists to OCRS, they are not deadlines set
by the companies. In other words, the company is not going to
chose not to accept your letter because it is not "date-stamped"
by the deadline. However, if you cut it too close, the company
may have already selected their candidates before they receive
your letter. Please note -- Period 8 and 9 are the periods with
the most delicate timing. In an effort to give you as much time
as possible during a hectic period, we have given you until December
30th to send cover letters for these periods. However, companies
must submit their invitation lists to OCRS by January 6th for
period 8 and January 10th for period 9. Therefore, if you wait
until right before the deadline it is advisable to express mail
your letters to the firm.

<P>
3. <B>IDENTIFY THE COMPANIES YOU REALLY WANT</B> to work for and
write only to those companies. Prioritize, by interest level,
the companies you are interested in, within deadline periods,
and start writing cover letters from the top of the list down.
If you can not get to all of the letters by the deadline at least
you will have mailed out the ones that are most important to you
early and the others will not be far behind.

<P>
4.<B> ORGANIZE YOUR CUSTOMIZING PROCESS.</B> You may want to develop
a template letter for each industry to which you plan on applying.
Then customize a sentence or two of each letter. Use the job descriptions
to help customize your letters. Check out the Internet to see
if the company you are writing to has a home page and use SPIKE
to Telnet to Lippincott. This may save you a trip to the library
or CD&amp;P for basic company information.

<P>
5. <B>DON'T TRY TO WRITE ALL YOUR COVER LETTERS IN ONE BLOCK</B>
of time. Between now and the write-in deadline, schedule periods
of time (as little as 1/2 hour will do) per day to work on letters.
Because you will have the write-in lists, in some cases, almost
a month in advance, plan to start early for the cover letters
for the first two periods. The first couple of letters may be
difficult, if you knock them off early on you will have less stress
later because the process will become slightly more rote.

<P>
6. <B>HELP COMPANIES GET YOUR LETTER TO THE RIGHT PLACE</B>.<B>
</B>Remember, companies are receiving hundreds of letters -- not
just from Wharton but from other schools too. On the outside of
the envelope on the lower left corner of the envelope write "Wharton
-- Schedule #______." This will ensure that your letter gets
to the right person as quickly as possible.

<P>
<B>SAMPLE COVER LETTERS</B> 

<P>
<B>Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning </B>

<P>
The following pages include sample cover letters. These letters
are intended to guide you and give you examples of effective styles.
It has come to our attention in the past that large numbers of
students have borrowed liberally from the samples we have provided.
This resulted in numerous phone calls from recruiters complaining
of "Wharton form letters." PLEASE keep in mind that
the purpose of the cover letter is to differentiate you. If all
Wharton cover letters are virtually the same, this defeats the
purpose all together.

<P>Dear Ms. Hubbard:

<P>
I am a second year MBA candidate at the Wharton School majoring
in marketing and strategic management. Recently I attended the
Nabisco campus presentation and dinner where I was able to learn
more about your company. Nabisco seems to offer significant responsibility
and challenge to the MBA graduate, while also providing a very
team-oriented, education-rich environment. I am interested in
working in this type of environment and would like to be considered
for your full-time Marketing Assistant position.

<P>
My eight years of work experience in marketing and operations
have allowed me to refine my leadership and analytical skills,
along with my abilities to think strategically. This summer, during
my summer internship in brand management at Procter &amp; Gamble,
I was able to utilize both my business school education and my
management experience in setting strategic direction and producing
positive business results. Throughout my career, I have had the
opportunity to work closely with customers to understand and meet
their needs.

<P>
I feel that my extensive work experience and my MBA education
will uniquely position me to be immediately productive and to
make a significant long-term contribution at Nabisco. I would
greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you when you
recruit at Wharton in November (Schedule 1493). Enclosed is a
copy of my resume for your review. Thank you for your time and
consideration.

<P>Dear Ms. Rolnick:

<P>
I am currently a first year student in the Wharton MBA Program,
and I am interested in pursuing job opportunities with Bear Stearns.
My goal is to expand my experiences in investment banking during
the summer of 1995, with a focus on obtaining full-time employment
upon my graduation from Wharton in the spring of 1996.

<P>
I feel that I can be a successful member of Bear Stearns. I worked
my way through college selling books door-to-door with the Southwestern
Company. During my five years with Southwestern, I consistently
placed as a top salesperson in the nation and successfully managed
large sales organizations. In order to prepare for a career in
investment banking, in 1992 I moved to Chicago and earned a position
with Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin through a self-initiated
job search. During my two years with Houlihan Lokey, I gained
first-hand experience in the financial advisory business. In addition,
by following a self-initiated study schedule I passed both the
CPA exam and the first two levels of the CFA exams.

<P>
I am very interested in pursuing my interests in Bear Stearns,
and I would appreciate being included on your interview schedule.
If you have any questions feel free to call me at (215) 000-0000.

I'd like to take this opportunity to explain my interest in COMPANY
and my status as a foreign national.

<P>
I am interested in COMPANY because of the bank's presence in western
Europe. The European countries span a broad political and economic
spectrum, and provide a diversity which I find exciting. I have
lived and worked in England and France in the past, and I hope
to return to that part of the world next year as I resume my career.
European industrial and financial markets are vital, both to American
industry and in their own right, and I am interested in their
future development.

<P>
I am particularly interested in the description which you forwarded
to the Wharton School of COMPANY'S Financial Advisory Department.
My academic employment backgrounds have prepared me for research
and analysis at both company/micro level and the national/macroeconomic
level, and I feel that my particular strength lies in my ability
to relate national macroeconomic developments to the securities
and currency markets.

I am now in the process of claiming citizenship through my paternal

please do not hesitate to call me if you have questions about
my qualifications or citizenship status. Thank you for your consideration.

I enjoyed the dynamic presentation of the Boston Consulting Group,

BCG is a company with whom I would like to pursue a career. As
a Swiss national I intend to work within the European Community
after receiving my MBA degree from Wharton. Working with your
Munich office as a summer intern for 1996 would not only constitute
an excellent start in my consulting career, but also allow me
to contribute to BCG's role in the emerging European market.

My consulting assignments in Switzerland and my various international



professional and academic exposures have well prepared me for
playing an active role in a consulting team. Particularly, my
management experience in organizational structuring and strategic

as well as my strong communication and negotiation skills will
be of value in a consulting environment.

<P>Dear Ms. Weiner:

<P>
I am a second year student at The Wharton School majoring in finance.
I am interested in continuing my career in sales and trading and
would like to be considered for your interview #1813. My prior
experience at MGSI Securities and Citicorp Securities has provided
valuable training and product knowledge that make me an ideal
candidate for a position with Stanford C. Bernstein.

<P>
As a summer associate with Citicorp Securities, I rotated through
the Emerging Markets, High Yield, Corporate and Government sales
and trading areas. My summer experience allowed me to enhance
my knowledge and understanding of sales, reading and fixed income
products. As a fixed income salesman for MGSI Securities, I built
a client of institutions that included money managers, insurance
companies, public funds and banks. During my first year, I won
the MGSI Sales Award based on product knowledge, effort, attitude
and teamwork. I was promoted to Vice President after only one
year in sales due to my new account generation, product knowledge
and gross commission. In addition, I actively developed and distributed



investment alternative memoranda to both clients and other salespeople.
Before leaving MGSI. I was ranked 7 out of 52 brokers based on
gross commission.

<P>
I believe my previous experience in fixed income sales trading
and trading will allow me to make an immediate and significant
contribution to your firm. I look forward to the opportunity to
speak with you or a representative of Stanford C. Bernstein in
the near future.

I am a first-year MBA student at The Wharton School and am interested

care delivery, I have gained insights into how hospitals, like
many businesses, attempt to deal with changes, such as adverse
regulation, increasing costs and consolidation pressures.

<P>
I have the analytic and creative problem solving skills essential
to an effective consultant. As a member of several health care
research teams at UNDERGRAD UNIVERSITY, I proved my ability to
creatively enhance research efficacy and accuracy by twenty percent
by improving administrative procedures and developing written
guidelines. In doing so, I established the productive and satisfying



relationships with department heads, as well as with peers and
technicians needed in a consultative role.

<P>
My skills and experience, complemented by my course work, enable
me to make an immediate and marketable contribution to COMPANY,
especially with health care clients. I am very interested in arranging
an interview with you and will contact your office within the

<P>Dear Ms. Greene:

<P>
I am a first year MBA student at the Wharton School, majoring
in Finance. I have attended several events held by CS First Boston,
and had the great pleasure to meet a number of people, including
Mr. XXX and Mr. XXX. I am impressed with the CS First Boston Corporation's



Leadership position in the Global Investment Banking industry
and would like to pursue a career with your organization.

<P>
As a business engineer who has been fascinated and involved in
advising clients and structuring financial solutions which satisfy
their needs, an organization such as CS First Boston Corporation
would provide a rich and fertile environment for my diverse skills.
My various professional and academic experiences have prepared
me well for an active role in an Investment Banking team. My engineering



background provided me with strong quantitative and analytical
skills. By co-founding a company, I have honed my entrepreneurial
skills and have got sound and concrete experience to risk analysis.
I am intrigued by the many innovative financial solutions that
continue to drive the industry, and am excited about being involved
in tackling challenging projects.

<P>
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my experience and interest
in CS First Boston Corporation in greater detail. In particular,
I would like to be included on your interview schedule (#1168)
at Wharton this February. I wish you a pleasant and healthy holiday
season and a Happy New Year. Thank you for your consideration.

<P>Dear Ms. Fellows:

<P>
I am a first year MBA candidate at the Wharton School. I am interested
in pursuing a career in management consulting and enjoyed the
presentation by XYZ, Inc. on September 21st. I had the pleasure
of meeting Mr. ABC when he was on campus and learning about the
challenging opportunities at XYZ, Inc. I am writing to explore
your hiring needs for the position of summer intern.

<P>
I have the skills and experience necessary to thrive in consulting.
Before coming to Wharton, I gained three years of experience in
engineering consulting with the automotive industry. My success
in previous consulting engagements has depended on my ability
to work closely with our clients to define, analyze and solve
a variety of problems with the ultimate goal of adding value to
the client organization. The combination of my strong analytical
and interpersonal skills has helped me carry out a full range
of successful assignments. These assignments have included interviewing
clients, training personnel and assisting clients in implementing
solutions.

<P>
I am confident that my background combined with my education at
Wharton, will enable me to make immediate and significant contributions
to ABC, Inc. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications
in greater detail and would like to be invited to interview with
you when you visit Wharton January 22, 1996.

<P>
Thank you for your time and consideration.

<P>Dear Ms. Pontes-Alves:

<P>
I am a first year MBA student at the Wharton School and I would
like to be considered for a summer Associate position in your
London office.

<P>
After three years in financial markets I am looking for new challenges
and I think that a career in management consulting would give
me unique professional opportunities. In particular, Bain's leading
position among strategy consulting firms, its strong tradition
of innovative solutions to its clients' needs and its global nature
make it the ideal answer to my career goals.

<P>
My background in financial markets has provided me with strong
analytical skills and the ability to understand complex relationships
among economic variable; moreover, as a member of the team that
set up the currency options desk of ZYZ, I shared responsibility
for this important project and developed effective teamwork skills.

<P>
I believe m experience and skills, coupled with my Wharton studies,
are an asset that could be of interest to Bain and I hope you
will consider my application for your Summer Associate program.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

<P>Dear Ms. Doright:

<P>
Recently I read an article on Environmental Corporation in Time
Magazine. I became very interested in your firm and its strong
commitment to applying teamwork efforts in improving the environment.
Currently, I am an MBA student at the Wharton School studying
strategic planning and I also have an engineering degree from
XYZ University. After graduation, I plan to combine my business
and technical degrees by working in corporate planning for an
environmentally oriented firm.

<P>
Before coming to Wharton I worked for ABC Company for three years.
At ABC, I was assigned to a team that investigated, reported and
designed wastewater treatment facilities. After my first year
with this team, I was promoted to team leader, a position which
involved planning the activities of the group and supervising
team members as well as non-technical personnel. I was also heavily
involved in my firm's interaction with environmental and regulatory
groups. My combination of technical skills, understanding of the
industry, and the business skills I have gained at Wharton will
allow me to make an immediate contribution to your firm.

<P>
I will be in the San Diego area in January and would greatly appreciate
an opportunity to discuss employment opportunities at Environmental
Corporation. I will call you office next week to see if there
is a convenient time for us to meet.

<P>I am a first year MBA student at the Wharton School. During my
research for a class project on the effectiveness of direct mailing
I came across your name as a leader in assisting companies with
direct mail marketing. Before coming to Wharton I worked at a
small cosmetics firm. One of the last projects I was involved
with at the firm was assisting in the development of a direct
mail system to potential customers. This project peaked my interest
in direct mail and I am interested in applying my previous marketing
experience and the skills I am gaining here at Wharton to help
firms better utilize this dynamic marketing tool.

<P>
As I begin my job search, I am trying to gather as much information
and advice as possible and I know I could greatly benefit from
your experience and knowledge. I will be in Connecticut in the
next two weeks, perhaps we could meet briefly. I would value any
advice you can give me on resume development and firms that might
be interested in my qualifications and appreciate any amount of
time you can give me. I will call you office next week to see
if there is a convenient time for us to meet.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
In the last year, IMNET has posted revenue growth of over 200% and has reinforced its leadership position in the electronic information and document management segment of the healthcare information services industry (HCIS). IMNET has also significantly strengthened its Electronic Information Warehouse (EIW) product line through three acquisitions and has won the endorsement of several leading HCIS companies which have agreed to exclusive distribution arrangements with the Company. IMNET's channel relationships give it preferred access to over 2700 hospitals and to about 60% of the large group practice market. 
<P>
For an encore in FY97, we expect IMNET to (i) generate 89% top-line and triple-digit earnings growth through increased penetration of the healthcare market; (ii) develop alliances with additional HCIS vendors, provider organizations, and non-healthcare channels; and (iii) continue to strengthen its product offerings both through acquisition and through internal development.
<P>
<B><I>Investment Highlights</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>Driven by the need to reduce overhead and improve operations, the electronic information and document management segment of the healthcare industry represents a $5 billion market opportunity. In the 1996 annual Health Information and Management Systems Society's (HIMSS) leadership survey, healthcare purchasing managers responded that one of their top healthcare automation priorities was the automation of the patient record. IMNET's EIW product line, which manages documents, medical images, and structured data from within one integrated framework, represents a critical enabling component of this effort.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
With the broadest and most open solution targeted to the healthcare industry, and the largest "blue chip" customer base of any direct competitor, IMNET is the clear leader in the healthcare electronic information and document management market. While a number of smaller competitors have cropped up over the last year, IMNET remains the premier player in the healthcare industry, effectively dominating the high-end of the market, and establishing a virtual "lock" on healthcare distribution channels.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
IMNET has used its strong product position to develop a formidable distribution channel. The Company has strategic alliances with leading HCIS vendors, including HBO & Company, Cerner, Citation, IDX Systems, Phamis, and OrNda. Together, these companies represent over 50% of the U.S. hospital market or over 2,800 distinct hospitals.</UL>
<P>
<B><I> Documents and Medical Images are Integral to the CPR</I></B>
<P>
<UL><LI>

IMNET's EIW consolidates all information within a healthcare enterprise and provides a complete information management solution by integrating current and historical information, regardless of storage media.  The solution, comprised of IMNET's Image Engine, Workflow Engine, Electronic Patient Record System, MedVision products, LaserArc, and MegaSAR, allows organizations to capture, store, retrieve, and manage information originated and stored on virtually all storage media.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>

As healthcare provider organizations confront mounting pressure to reduce their cost structure, cost-justifiable technologies like IMNET's EIW are becoming an increasing imperative. By implementing EIW, healthcare institutions can significantly reduce warehousing and personnel costs, shorten the billing cycle through improved workflow management, and provide the framework for an electronic patient record capable of integrating structured and unstructured medical, financial, and administrative data.  

</UL><BR><UL><LI>

With 52 contracted hospital clients and a number of large "blue chip" reference sites, IMNET has reached the critical mass necessary to raise EIW's profile as a viable and increasingly mainstream alternative to paper document management for the largest of healthcare institutions.  
The primary drivers behind IMNET's spectacular growth have been (i) the Company's tremendous marketing prowess, (ii) its outstanding technology, and (iii) the degree to which the Company's products provide "hard dollar" savings to hospitals that are both tangible and quantifiable.  Exhibit 2 represents the savings and return-on-investment as measured by actual IMNET clients.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
"Hard dollar" savings result from reduced length of stay, the elimination of duplicate tests, improved outcomes, and from improved cashflow from shorter billing cycles.  Additional intangible, or "soft dollar," benefits include improved access to information, which translates into increased productivity throughout the enterprise.

<P>
Macromedia is the leading provider of software tools for the creation of digital multimedia content.  The dominant provider of tools for PC and CD-ROM applications, Macromedia in the last 12 months has aggressively positioned itself to extend its leadership status to Internet/intranet applications. 
<P>
Despite upgrades to much of its product line in the March 1996 quarter, including the flagship Director and Director Multimedia Studio, the Company achieved sequential revenue growth of 1.2% and (11.4%) in the June and September quarters, respectively.  This revenue weakness translated to the bottom line, with EPS in each of those quarters falling below results achieved in March.
<P>
In our opinion, Macromedia's declining results are the result of three confluent trends.  First, the market for 2D graphics has slowed considerably, with growth likely falling below 10% per year, and as such, revenues from FreeHand and FreeHand Graphics Studio, which we estimate accounted for approximately 25% of Macromedia's FY:96 revenues, will likely be flat in FY:97.  Second, the growth of multimedia CD-ROM products, which historically have represented a large constituency of Macromedia users, are suffering through the economic realities of retail consumer software, resulting in significant consolidation and the failure of many smaller publishers.  Lastly, the Company's bundling strategy, while important for its goal of long-term market dominance, has served to cannibalize revenues from secondary products such as Extreme 3D.
<P>
While we remain fundamentally bullish on the long-term growth prospects for rich multimedia content generally, and Macromedia specifically, we believe short-term results will continue to be disappointing.  Despite significant architectural advances, including the MMX chip from Intel and 56k modems from U.S. Robotics, it will be some time before multimedia publishing on the Web compensates for the slowdowns in the graphics and retail CD-ROM markets.  Accordingly, we expect Macromedia to experience unexciting EPS comparisons for several quarters and rate the stock a NEUTRAL (3).

<P>
<B><I> The Leader in Digital Multimedia </B></I><P>

Macromedia's broad line of authoring tools address all the key areas of digital media - multimedia authoring, graphics, audio, Web publishing, and (in spring 1997) digital video.  Macromedia has therefore been ideally positioned to benefit from the explosive increase in digital multimedia in entertainment and corporate applications.  We believe, however, that we have arrived at a critical inflection point in the market.  Graphics professionals and retail CD-ROM developers, who to date have represented a significant percentage of the Company's user base and have been the primary drivers of the growth in the volume of digital multimedia content, have seen their growth slow considerably.  Meanwhile, the World Wide Web, the next major medium for multimedia content development, remains dominated by static, HTML-based content, and therefore has been unable to compensate for the slowing growth of these markets.  Therefore, while from a longer-term perspective we expect the use of digital multimedia to resume its explosive growth (with Web bandwidth enhancement and digital video disk likely to be key drivers), and expect  Macromedia to be a key beneficiary, we believe the short-term outlook calls for caution.<P>

<B><I>A Slowdown in Some of  Macromedia's Market Segments...</I></B><P>
<UL><LI><B>
Graphics.</B>  The market for 2D graphics, addressed by Freehand and FreeHand Graphics Studio, has slowed considerably in recent months; growth is likely below 10% per year at this juncture.  We estimate that revenue contribution from the FreeHand product line was approximately $35 million in FY:96, and that growth will be 0-5% in FY:97.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Multimedia CD-ROM.</B>  Macromedia is far and away the leading producer of authoring tools for multimedia CD-ROMS - we estimate that over 50% of all titles were created using Macromedia tools.  The retail CD-ROM industry, however, has come under significant pressure in the last year, as too many titles have been chasing too little shelf space.  This has led to massive industry consolidation (Softkey/Learning Company, IBM/Edmark, GT Interactive/Humongous). More importantly, the number of small developers-who used to represent a core customer group for Macromedia -has dramatically diminished.  Reason:  the high cost of creating quality titles, and the unfavorable economics of distributing them. Our research indicates that as few as 5% of the current 10,000 titles are profitable. Consumers will spend an estimated 40% less on CD-ROM titles this Christmas than last, which was hardly a robust holiday season for CD-ROM developers.  Therefore, while overall Director and Director Multimedia Studio sales remain strong, this section of that market (perhaps representing 15-20% of Director users) is slowing.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Secondary products.</B>  Macromedia sells several "secondary" products, including Extreme 3D, xRes, Fontographer and SoundEdit 16.  In FY:96, Macromedia instituted an aggressive bundling strategy, combining its flagship Director, FreeHand and Authorware products with these secondary products to form "suites," with standardized user interfaces and a common architectural framework for easy product integration.  While this strategy has served Macromedia's long-term objective to consolidate control of the multimedia market, giving developers all the tools they would need, it has served in the short term to cannibalize sales of those secondary products.  Thus, with suite sales reaching 60% of total revenues, we expect these secondary products, which contributed approximately $10 million in revenue in FY:96, to be flat in FY:97.</UL><P>

<B><I>...Has not Yet Been Recovered
By Growth in the Web Publishing</I></B><P>
<UL><LI>
The amount of content on the Web has obviously been growing at an astounding rate.  Alta Vista claims to have indexed 30 million pages of information; over 400 terabytes of data pass through the major network access points (NAPs) each month (up from 50 million in August 1995).  This trend shows no sign of slowing; in fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that it has accelerated in recent months.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Not surprisingly, many people and companies previously engaged in the CD-ROM business are now actively attacking Internet development, either through hybrid Web/CD-ROM applications or Web-only content.  Others have begun creating websites for the many corporations hoping to pitch their wares in cyberspace.  Last year, Macromedia wisely sought to leverage its 400,000-plus customer base by creating Shockwave and acquiring iband's BackStage product line, to provide these developers with sophisticated Internet tools.

<P>
In 1996, compressed margins in the commercial business and inadequate premiums and high medical utilization in the Medicare segment will result in Mid Atlantic Medical's first full-year operating loss in ten years. The Company has made progress toward correcting problems in its commercial and Medicare businesses. However, as the pricing and cost picture for 1997 begins to solidify, we think that the restoration of the Company's operating margins to near-historical levels is at least a year away. We no longer believe that the Company will be able to achieve profitability in Q4:96, but think a modest recovery is possible for 1997. We are lowering our Q4:96 EPS estimate to ($0.06) from $0.03, and cutting our FY97 estimate by $0.55 to $0.35. We continue to rate the shares NEUTRAL (3).

<P><BR>
<B><I> Medicare: Abandoning the Most Unprofitable Areas
</B></I>
<P><UL><LI>
The Company's Medicare business accounts for just 2% of fully-insured lives and only 5% of FY96 premium revenues, but will be responsible for a loss of approximately $0.20 per share in 1996. In total, the Company's MLR in the Medicare segment has approached 140% in the first nine months of 1996. Effective January 1, 1997, Mid Atlantic Medical will withdraw from the Medicare risk market in 57 counties, thereby disenrolling roughly 5,500 senior members. HCFA reimbursement in the affected areas averages approximately $330 pmpm, but the medical costs associated with these members has surpassed $400 pmpm. Although almost 40% of Mid Atlantic's Medicare membership will be given up, we estimate that the move will positively impact the Company's bottom line by about $0.10 per share next year. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
In addition to the regional realignment, Mid Atlantic has hired 20 case managers to focus on controlling the medical costs of the Company's 1,700 highest-acuity Medicare cases. Six months ago, only 300 members had been assigned a case manager. Now, senior enrollees are also given health-risk assessment surveys to identify their health risks as they join the HMO - not when they show up at the emergency room.</UL>
<P><BR>
<B><I> Medicare: Lackluster Enrollment Growth Expected to Continue </B></I>
<P>
<UL><LI>Despite having the largest HMO presence in its service area, the Company's Medicare risk product rollout has been disappointing. In 1996, the Company's monthly membership gain has averaged less than 800 new enrollees. Mid Atlantic's three competitors in Maryland have not performed much better, adding an average of about 615 new seniors per month. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI>We think that the lack of market response to the efforts of these plans can be partially attributed to the inexperience of providers in effectively managing the medical costs of the senior population in the State. The combination of a high cost structure and relatively low premiums has not provided the stimulus necessary for any HMO to aggressively penetrate the Medicare market in Maryland. We don't expect a substantial improvement in enrollment growth during 1997, as the Company is now focusing its sales efforts on a much smaller marketing area - those counties with HCFA reimbursement well above $400 pmpm. </UL>
<P><BR>
<B><I> Medicaid: A Sad Tale of Two States</B></I>
<P>
<UL><LI>
In a year of disappointments, Mid Atlantic Medical's lack of Medicaid enrollment growth 1996 has only added to the pain. As we look to 1997, it is possible that the Company will be forced to pare back its participation in the Medicaid segment even more.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
The State of Virginia currently operates two HMO Medicaid programs: a mandated plan in the Tidewater region that currently covers 93,000 Medicaid recipients and an optional program in the rest of the State that covers approximately 34,000 lives. Mid Atlantic Medical, which has a 57% share of the optional statewide program, received a 4-5% premium increase for those lives, effective July 1, 1996. We believe this program makes a reasonable contribution to operating earnings.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Virginia is currently seeking material reductions in premium rates with those health plans, including Mid Atlantic Medical, that are participating in the Tidewater HMO mandate. Approximately 56% of the Company's Virginia Medicaid membership is affected. Due to the proposed cuts, Mid Atlantic notified the State that it would be withdrawing from the Tidewater program, effective January 1, 1997. As a result, Virginia has indicated a willingness to negotiate, requesting a counteroffer from Mid Atlantic. The Company submitted its newest proposal on December 2, and we expect a resolution to this crisis very shortly. There is still a good possibility that Mid Atlantic will exit the Tidewater program, but the State's recent flexibility is encouraging.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
A similar situation is brewing in Maryland. The State has received a Section 1115 waiver to operate a mandated Medicaid HMO program, effective January 1, 1996. About 225,000 Medicaid recipients will be required to choose a participating HMO or will be enrolled in one by the State. Maryland has indicated that it wants to rollback premiums by 15% and increase the benefits offered to Medicaid recipients under the mandate. As in Virginia, we think that a substantial number of providers would walk away from the Maryland Medicaid program if forced to absorb a 15% rate cut.   
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Mid Atlantic Medical currently covers approximately 44,000 Medicaid lives in Maryland. Management has been frank in its discussions with the State, indicating that it will disenroll its current Medicaid membership and won't participate in the mandate if the premium cuts are implemented. The Company is working with the State to reach a solution, even suggesting a profit-sharing arrangement. We think that competing HMOs have similar issues with the State, which will likely delay the rollout of the mandate beyond January. Due to this uncertainty and the wide range of possible outcomes, we are assuming no growth in Medicaid enrollment in 1997.</UL><P>
<BR>
<B><I> Commercial Price Increases Should Provide Margin Relief</I></B><P>

<UL><LI>
Based on indications from the current open enrollment season, we think that Mid Atlantic Medical will receive an average commercial premium increase of 6% for business that renews January 1, 1997. Net premium increases of this magnitude are likely through the balance of 1997 as well. If the Company can hold per member medical cost increases to 3% or less, the new premium structure will go a long way toward rebuilding a normal (5-7% operating margin) level of profitability. We therefore expect commercial margins to improve slowly, but steadily, as 1997 progresses. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Management has become more disciplined in its pricing strategy and has demonstrated its willingness to walk away from unprofitable business in 2H:96. However, we don't expect the price hikes to hurt commercial enrollment growth too much, as the Company's competitors - blindsided by the same adverse medical cost trends as Mid Atlantic Medical - have also been raising premiums. We think that the Company will add 35,000 new commercial lives during the first quarter of 1997.</UL><P>

<P>
Whittman-Hart is a rapidly growing supplier of information technology (IT) services to mid-market companies.  The Company offers a broad range of IT services including application-package implementation, custom-software development, workgroup computing, system engineering, and technology/business planning.  These services allow Whittman-Hart's customers to benefit from the significant advances in computer technology without employing in-house a large and sophisticated staff. The average P/E multiple on CY96 EPS estimates for comparable information technology service providers is 56x (higher than Whittman-Hart's P/E multiple). Our 12-month target price of $56.25 is based on a conservative P/E multiple of 45 times our FY98 EPS of $1.25. We rate the stock a Buy (2).

<P><BR>
<UL><LI><B>
Enormous market a with broad range of requirements  . </B>The market for information technology consulting and systems integration services is large and well established.  Organizations such as Whittman-Hart serve a well documented need to augment the internal technical capability of business seeking to build next generation business systems. International Data Corporation estimates the domestic market for services like those provided by Whittman-Hart was $34 billion in 1995 with 14% projected growth.  Dataquest Worldwide Services Group estimates the worldwide market for IT services will reach $292 billion by 2000.  
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Mid-market focus.</B>   Whittman-Hart is a rapidly growing supplier of information technology (IT) services to mid-market companies and divisions of Fortune 1000 organizations. The Company offers a broad range of IT services including application package implementation, custom software development, workgroup computing, system engineering, and technology/business planning.  These services allow Whittman Hart's customers to benefit from continuing advances in computer technology without employing in-house large and sophisticated staffs. The Company serves clients in a broad range of industries, including communications, consumer products, distribution, financial services, insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, professional services, retail and technology.  By focusing on companies with revenue of $50-500 million or similar sized divisions of Fortune 1000 organizations the Company has discovered a niche essentially ignored by the major consulting companies. The major vendors of IT integration services, have created business models and pricing structures incompatible with the needs of all but the largest business enterprises.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Growth oriented business strategy.</B>    Whittman-Hart has made substantial investments of time and financial resources into the development of systems, methodologies, training programs and infrastructure capable of supporting a much larger organization.  The Company is pursuing its strategy to become the leading single source provider of IT services to mid-sized companies. These investments have enabled the Company to expand rapidly, while improving operating margins. During 1995, revenue expanded 69% to $49.8 million, and 80% in the first three quarters of 1996 to $62.2 million (without any acquisitions), while operating margins expanded from 4.2% to 7.5%, respectively.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Local presence.</B>   An increasingly critical factor in the Company's success is its commitment to offering a local presence through branch offices and client support centers.  The Company demonstrates its commitment to each local market and enhances its ability to attract skilled, locally-based consultants by delivering its services to clients through a branch network.  This network also increases consultant productivity and satisfaction, enhancing responsiveness and minimizing travel expense.  Furthermore, the local branch offices establish greater name recognition for the Company and increase referrals for its services within the local potential client base.  Currently, Whittman-Hart has operations in 6 cities, centered in the mid-west. We expect continual expansion to new locations, through internal start-ups and acquisition. The Company has targeted 25 cities as potential branch office locations.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Competitive edge.</B>   In situations where a detailed proposal is undertaken, the Company has experienced a win rate over 50% by contract value.  Factors responsible for Whittman-Hart's success include access to senior management, a higher percentage of experienced consultants, lower cost,  greater flexibility, and a practical approach to project management.  As a result, we expect Whittman-Hart to continue to grow substantially faster than the overall market.  
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Risk factors.</B>  Presently, Whittman-Hart is starting to bid more frequently on larger projects in the $1.0 million class.  While the Company has executed client engagements of this size, management has limited experience in this market and must gain more experience in projects of this magnitude. In addition, the Company makes an up-front investment (accounted for as an ordinary operating expense) of approximately $1.75 million in a new branch prior to generating material revenue. Lastly, Whittman-Hart has targeted acquisitions as a part of its growth strategy. Management has minimal experience in this area, which can be a mine-field for small growing companies.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Forecast.</B>    We estimate that on revenue growth of 72.6% in 1996 to $86.0 million, the Company will generate EPS of $0.59, a 245% increase from the $0.17 reported in 1995. For 1997, we project a further 41% increase in revenues, and a 45% increase in EPS, to $0.86. We expect operating earnings to grow faster than revenue as the company benefits from investments in infrastructure made in 1995. We project operating margins of 8.0% in 1996, compared to 3.4% in 1995. We expect continued operating margin expansion in 1997 to 9.7%, and in 1998 to 11.0%.</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>

Price target makes Whittman-Hart an attractive investment.</B>  Whittman-Hart's stock is now trading at a P/E of 75x our estimated 1996 EPS of $0.59, and 51x our estimated 1997 EPS of $0.86.  We base our 12 month price target of $56.25 on a 45x P/E on projected 1998 EPS of $1.25.  Currently, the comparable company average is trading at a 56x P/E on 1997 EPS and has a projected 28% revenue growth rate as compared to our estimated 45% for Whittman-Hart.</UL>

The Sales Department covers a tightly controlled number of institutional brokerage clients around the world.

Clients can choose to receive data in a hard copy via mail, in a fax, a phone digest or direct electronic delivery.
<P>
A team of highly experienced Sales Traders maintain direct and frequent contact throughout the trading day with institutional traders at the accounts frequently relaying order, offering and market developments to clients. A separate team of listed and OTC Market Makers (also called "traders") maintain the Firm's positions in the stocks in which the Firm makes a market <I>nearly a hundred</I>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Concentra Corporation develops, markets, and supports software products that automate the engineering process.  A significant portion of the time it takes to develop new products goes into performing well-defined, repetitive engineering tasks, optimizing designs across multiple disciplines, and building, testing and modifying prototypes.  While computer aided design (CAD) systems provide solutions to the geometric aspects of these problems, the Company has developed an innovative approach based on generative technology which addresses the full scope of the problems encountered in the engineering design and development process.  This new approach enables companies to capture the way engineering practices are performed and generate new designs directly from functional specifications.  As a result, engineering productivity and time to market are improved as engineers automate repetitive but time consuming tasks and are able to spend more time on valuable, creative work.

<b>Former mayor Wayne Pomeroy appointed to City Council</b><p>

<p>

     Former Mayor Wayne Pomeroy, whose great-grandfather helped to found Mesa, is the newest member of the City Council.<p>

     Wayne was unanimously appointed to the City Council to fill the vacant seat until someone is elected during the 1998 elections to serve the remainder of the council term, which expires in June 2000.<p>

     Born in Mesa, Wayne is a fourth-generation resident whose great-grandfather, Francis Martin Pomeroy, organized the <i>Mesa Company</i> in 1878 and helped found the City. He is a 1941 graduate of Mesa High School and a Silver Star, Air Medal and Purple Heart decorated World War II Army veteran.<p>

     Wayne has a bachelor's degree in business administration from Brigham Young University and a master's degree from New York University. He started Pomeroy's Wearing Apparel, a men's clothing store in downtown Mesa that eventually grew to 14 stores. He has since sold the stores, but still owns the original Pomeroy's at 136 W. Main St.<p>

    During his tenure as mayor (1976-1980) and councilmember (1966-1974), Wayne saw Mesa through a period of rapid growth. The City constructed a much-needed Community Center complex, a City Council Chambers, expanded Falcon Field Airport and secured routing and construction of the Superstition Freeway.<p>

    "I'm honored to serve our City again at the request of Mayor Brown and the City Council," Wayne said. "Most of my life has been spent in Mesa, and it's very special to me, having been able to own a business for 45 years in Mesa. I've always been proud of the way Mesa is operated. From what I've seen, we have an excellent Mayor and City Council."

<BLOCKQUOTE>ArthroCare Corporation, located in Sunnyvale, California, designs, develops, manufactures and markets arthroscopic surgical equipment.  The Company's Product ("the Arthroscopic System") is designed to replace the multiple surgical tools used in arthroscopic procedures with one multi-purpose electrosurgery system that ablates (removes) soft tissue while simultaneously achieving hemostasis (sealing small bleeding vessels).  This allows the surgeon to remove damaged tissue while reducing the frequent exchange of instruments that is common in arthroscopic procedures.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Purified bovine collagen is used to replace or repair diseased, damaged, or aged tissues in the human body.  The company has already introduced products for three broad medical specialties -- dermatology/cosmetic surgery, orthopaedics, and urology.  The company's original products, Zyderm and Zyplast, are used to fill in facial wrinkles and acne scars.  Collagen's Collagraft bone grafting product is used to treat fractures and defects in bone.  That product is marketed by Zimmer, a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  Collagen's Contigen is used to treat urinary stress incontinence, which is the loss of bladder control.  Contigen, the first truly effective treatment for incontinence, is marketed by C.R. Bard, Inc.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The home medical care market is the fastest growing sector of the entire U.S. health care industry, and Invacare is one of two major manufacturers of home medical equipment that will benefit most from the strong underlying growth trends for this sector (the other is Sunrise Medical, Inc.). Invacare manufactures and markets products for the physically disabled and for patients receiving medical treatment in alternative site facilities or in the home. The company's products include powered and manual wheelchairs, patient aids, respiratory therapy devices, therapeutic mattress overlays to prevent and treat pressure sores, and home infusion therapy equipment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Optical Sensors, Inc., headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was founded in 1989 to develop point-of-care monitoring systems for arterial blood gases and other critical blood analytes.  Fast, accurate, and frequent ABG results are essential to guide the treatment of patients in the operating room and intensive care unit.  Optical Sensors' technology provides a noninvasive, cost-effective solution to these needs and offers the unique benefits of integrating the ABG results with existing patient bedside monitors.  In addition, the Company's technology helps protect patients from hospital-borne infections and healthcare workers from exposure to blood.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
UroMed has developed the Reliance Insert for the treatment of urinary incontinence in women.  The Reliance represents one of the best ways to address the large, under-served incontinence market.  The device is a small, flexible plug that is inserted into the urethra to stop the leakage of urine at its source.  To date, UroMed has gotten excellent indications of safety and efficacy in its U.S. clinical trial of the device. The company has submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for review of the Reliance.  We believe that the product can be approved under the 510(k).  Other upcoming milestones will be the signing of additional overseas marketing agreements. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="franklin-bg"><B>Franklin Electronic Publishers, Inc.</B></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Franklin publishes hand-held digital books, a medium it created in 1986, and has sold over eight million units to date.  Market share peaked at about 80% in 1988, when on the heels of Franklin's success in creating this new consumer electronics product catagory, several larger companies, including Texas Instruments, Smith Corona, Seiko, Selectronics (partially owned by Xerox), and about five or six other players entered the electronic book market.  The predictable result was stiff price competition followed by an industry shake-up with most of the other competitors dropping out of the market and Franklin sustaining losses for two years.  In fiscal 1992 Franklin returned to profitability, and sales and earnings have been growing 
since then.  The company estimates its domestic market share for hand-held 
digital books at appoxiamtely 70%.

You can call SRP at 236-3587.<p>Mesa has 23,000 street lights and we work hard to keep them in  excellent condition through preventive maintenance and repair. Your calls advising us of problems are an important part of this process.
<p>

<b> <center>Photo safety program is in full gear</b></center>
<p>
Last month, the City announced the start of Mesa's photo safety program, a
one-year pilot program designed to reduce the number of injury accidents in
Mesa. Using a combination of three speed vans plus cameras installed at 12
intersections to photograph drivers who speed excessively or who run red lights, Mesa hopes to reduce the number of accidents and deaths caused by
automobile accidents.<p>In 1995, Mesa's police and firefighters responded to 16,000 accidents. At the 2,459 automobile accidents with injuries, firefighters treated 7,020 victims, many in critical condition. Of those 2,459 accidents, 1,594 happened at intersections. In 1995, 37 people were killed in traffic accidents.<p>Mesa's goal is to reduce these tragic numbers by at least 5 percent. As a part of this program, Mesa studied several intersections. In a 24-hour period at nine major Mesa intersections, 1,906 people ran red lights.  If we reach our goal of just 5 percent this year, there will be 123 less injury accidents. At least 350 people will be spared injury or death. What are the chances one of those people could be you, someone you love, or someone you know?<p>Since January 1, people who drive past a speed van at 11 miles over the posted speed limit might receive a citation. The speed vans will be working within a one-mile radius of the following intersections: Country Club and Southern; Mesa Drive and Southern; Stapley and Southern; Stapley and Main Street; Stapley and Broadway; Mesa Drive and Broadway; Val Vista and Southern; Gilbert and University; Gilbert and Brown; Lindsay and University; Lindsay and Main Street; and Lindsay and Broadway.<p>Red light cameras were installed at 12 high-accident intersections in late November. They work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
<p>
<b>Here's how they work. </b><p>
<p>
Two pole-mounted cameras are connected to two sensors buried into the pavement in the crosswalk. If the first sensor detects a vehicle entering the crosswalk after the traffic signal turns red, it activates the cameras,
shooting two pictures of the vehicle entering the intersection. When the vehicle crosses the second sensor, the two cameras fire again. Four photos are taken in all: two of the vehicle's license plate, two of the vehicle's
driver. The photos show the date, time, location and length of the preceding
amber light and elapsed time into the red light cycle when the violation
occurred.<p>The camera film is changed daily and the photographic evidence is matched with automobile registration information supplied by the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles. A citation is then mailed to the vehicle's registered owner. The actual photos are not mailed.  If you wish to view the photographs, you can do so at the Photo Safety Violations Bureau, 101 E. 1st Avenue, Mesa.  The fine for running a red light is $96 and the minimum speeding ticket fine is $104.<p>These cameras and speed vans are freeing up a valuable resource, Mesa's police officers, to respond to neighborhood complaints of speeders on smaller streets, in school zones, and past school buses.<p>So please obey the traffic laws for the sake of everyone in Mesa. Instead of becoming a statistic, we'd prefer you and your family slow down
and drive safely when in Mesa. Smile for traffic safety.<b><p>

<center><b>Smile for Photo Safety Program</b><p>

</center>
Slow down and drive safely. That's the message Mesa is asking drivers to follow
starting in December when Mesa's new photo safety program starts.  This program is
designed to reduce injury accidents from people who speed and run red lights.<p>

Photo safety technology combines the use of cameras, sensors and radar to record
drivers running red lights and drivers who speed. Mesa installed cameras at 12
intersections identified as sites where drivers chronically speed and run red lights. After a traffic signal displays a red light, drivers crossing a sensor in the pavement will
arm the cameras. When they cross a second sensor in the intersection, the cameras
will record the front and rear of the vehicle. Signs will be posted at major entrances to
Mesa so drivers will know they are in an enforcement area.<p>

The 12 intersections where cameras are to be installed are: Country Club and
Southern; Mesa and Southern; Stapley and Southern; Stapley and Main; Stapley and
Broadway; Mesa and Broadway; Greenfield and University; Greenfield and Main;
Higley and Brown; Recker and Main; Power and Main; and Power and Broadway.Mesa also is using three speed cameras in plainly-marked police vans to record
drivers who have dangerous violations of Mesa's speed laws. Police service officers
will operate the vans.<p>

When a violation occurs during the month of December, a warning will be issued to
the registered owner of the vehicle. Starting Jan. 1, tickets will be issued to the
registered owner of the vehicle. The citation will be issued only if the photos clearly
show the vehicle, driver's face and license plate.If the vehicle's registered owner is different from the person driving the car, the
owner may complete a portion of the citation which identifies the driver and return it
by mail. The ticket can be dismissed and reissued to the driver.The photo safety program was implemented because the number one traffic
complaint of Mesa residents is speeding, followed closely by people who run red
lights. These reckless drivers threaten everyone's safety and compromise the quality of
our community and neighbor-hood life. So slow down, drive safely and smile for traffic
safety!<p>

When temperatures start to drop, be sure to have your furnace serviced. You should
also learn to recognize the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless and toxic gas, usually is formed by
incomplete combustion of any fuel containing carbon such as propane, kerosene,
gasoline, fuel oil and natural gas.Carbon monoxide poisoning causes flu-like symptoms, such as headaches,
drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dimmed vision, fluttering or throbbing of the
heart, impaired judgment and general fatigue.If you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning or are experiencing any of the symptoms
described, leave your home and call your local gas utility. In Mesa, the number is
644-4277. Please call us 24-hours a day.<p>

<b><u><H1>BUDGET</H1></u></b>

The City of Mesa's budget is essentially like that of a private business or of a family that tries to figure out how much money it can spend, depending on how much money it earns. 

The City makes money or generates revenues, through charges for some services provided, fees and taxes. The City also spends money or has expenditures, in order to operate and provide services to its citizens.

Like a family on a fixed income, the City also must carefully plan and develop a budget, which is a breakdown of how much money the City expects to make and how much it plans to spend. Every year, the budget for the following year is carefully planned, using precise estimates, so that the City will not spend more money than it expects to earn.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<BR><P>
Accom, a leading provider of digital video systems for professionals in the television and film industries, is well-positioned to grow earnings at least 30% annually over the next three years, driven largely by the Company's virtual set product.  The Company's stock sells at approximately 20 times our calendar 1996 EPS estimate of $0.46, which represents a substantial discount to other digital tools stocks.

<BR><P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Market leader.</B> Accom is a market leader in providing on-line digital editing systems.  The Company has 2,600 systems installed worldwide, and has won several industry awards, including two Emmys for technical excellence.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Large market opportunity.</B> The market for high-end post-production tools is large - approximately $1.7 billion - and is converting rapidly from analog-tape-based to digital-software-based tools.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Strong core business, with big upside opportunity in virtual sets.</B> Accom's core business grew 19.5% during the first nine months of this year; its newly acquired virtual set technology should enable the Company's growth to accelerate dramatically in 1996.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Experienced management team.</B> The Company's senior management team has lengthy industry experience, and has benefited from last year's addition of an excellent chief operating officer.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Rapid earnings growth should result in substantial stock price appreciation.</B> Twelve months from now, we think Accom's stock will trade at approximately 25 times our preliminary CY97 EPS estimate of $0.75, which implies a $19 price.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Advanced Health Corporation provides a full range of management services and proprietary clinical information systems to physician group practices and networks. The Company is facing a $62 billion opportunity in its core regional markets, the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states.  We believe that these markets will experience extremely rapid growth over the next few years, as managed care is just beginning to take hold in these regions.  
<P>
We think Advanced Health's core services, technologies, and competitive advantages should support growth of at least 35% annually for the next few years.  Accordingly, we initiated coverage of Advanced Health with a BUY (2) rating on October 29, 1996, and set a one-year price target of $23. 

<P>
<B><I> Summary </B></I><P>
<UL><LI><B>
Large, Under-penetrated, High-Growth Market for Physician Practice Management Services. </B>  Several factors effecting physician practices - including increasingly complex reimbursement processes, downward pressure on medical fees, loss of clinical autonomy, pressures to affiliate, and increased data management requirements - are working together to increase demand for physician practice management services.  We estimate that the PPM industry is a $200 billion market opportunity and that all the public companies combined account for less than 10% of the total.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Concentrating on Emerging Regions for Managed Care.</B>  In the Northeast region of the U.S. - a region that accounts for approximately $62 billion in healthcare expenditures - managed care is just beginning to take hold. Average per capita healthcare costs in this region are significantly higher than in other markets where managed care is more entrenched. Costs will be cut in the Northeast as managed care organizations increase their market share, and physicians will be driven into group practices and networks to survive. For example, Oxford Health Plans, the leading HMO in the Northeast, is projected to grow by 40% per annum over the next two years. This represents a tremendous opportunity for Advanced Health, as one of the only public PPMs addressing the Northeast region, to ride the coattails of managed care growth in this region.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Targeting High-Cost, High-Volume Specialties.</B>   Advanced Health has focused on implementing a multi-specialty disease management strategy which initially targets physician practices in the fields of cardiology, orthopedics, and oncology. In 1992, spending on cardiology, orthopedics, and oncology totaled about $200 billion and represented approximately 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of U.S. healthcare expenses.  These high-cost, high-volume specialties are procedure intensive, involve multiple disciplines (i.e., subspecialties), and generally provide services in a fragmented fashion throughout the continuum of care.  Additionally, today's payors want demonstrably superior quality, easier access to specialists, case rate contracting, and obviously, lower medical costs.  Accordingly, the Company has a significant opportunity to offer disease management strategies that are applicable to the full range of services required by heart, cancer, and orthopedic patients, and that are certain to appeal to the majority of managed care payors. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Capitalizing on the Convergence of the PPM and HCIS Industries.</B>   The single most important trend in healthcare today is the movement toward physician group practices and physician networks, which necessitates major expenditures for financial, administrative, and clinical information systems. In fact, growth in the HCIS industry is skyrocketing, with the fastest growth sector being physician practice management systems. Advanced Health has developed proprietary clinical information systems which allow physicians to access patient-specific clinical and payor information at the point of care, thus impacting the cost and quality of patient care. Consequently, the Company is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of both of these sectors. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Partnering with Physicians, Not "Owning" Them.</B>   Advanced Health organizes and manages physician practices through an MSO, a joint venture between the Company and the physician practices, with each party owning approximately 50% of the equity.  As such, Advanced Health provides a very attractive partnership option to a broad cross-section of the physician community: members gain access to management systems and technology otherwise not available to them, while maintaining equity in their own practices.  Accordingly, we think the Company will be a major beneficiary of the very large and rapidly growing market for physician practice management services. 
</UL><BR>

<B><I>Investment Risks</I></B><BR>
<UL><LI><B>Limited Operating History.</B>  The Company, incorporated in August 1993, began providing physician practice and network management services in December 1995 and only recently started installing clinical information systems on a commercial basis.  Currently, the Company has only a limited number of physician groups and networks under management, and has not yet achieved profitability.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>

Uncertainty of Successful Commercialization of Clinical Information Systems.</B>  The Company has been developing its clinical information system since 1993; however, these systems have only been commercially installed on a limited basis.  The revenue projections we have established for the Company and its future profitability are dependent upon market acceptance of its clinical information systems.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>

Concentration of  Revenues.</B>   The Company's revenue to date has been derived from management agreements with a limited number of physician groups and networks.  For the six months ended June 30, 1996, Madison Medical - The Private Practice Group of New York, L.L.P. (Madison) and Advanced Heart Physicians & Surgeons Network P.C. accounted for 49% and 23% of revenues, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1995, Madison accounted for approximately 36% of the Company's revenues, and an affiliate of Eli Lilly & Company accounted for approximately 32% of revenues. In addition, the Company's agreement with Madison may be terminated after December 31, 1996.  However, Madison would have to pay the Company a break-up fee of $250,000 and would lose all of its MSO equity value (worth about $1.5 million at the current share price for ADVH).
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>

Declining Reimbursement Rates.</B>  In general, the healthcare industry is still experiencing a trend toward cost containment.  Accordingly, fees paid to physicians for medical services from third-party payors, particularly managed care programs, are declining.  In the face of declining reimbursement rates, the Company may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>

Risks Associated with Capitated Payments.</B>   The Company anticipates entering into managed care or capitated arrangements, either on behalf of its affiliated physicians or through the formation of an independent physician association (IPA).  To the extent that costs associated with the medical, management, and administrative services provided by the Company and its affiliated physicians exceed the pre-determined capitated fee for those services, the Company will record its proportional amount of those losses. The Company has only limited experience in negotiating or managing capitated fee arrangements, and it has no experience in forming or managing an IPA.
</UL>
<B><I>Industry Overview</I></B><BR>
<UL>
A significant trend driving the healthcare industry today is the desire to curtail the growth of healthcare expenditures. Since physicians control approximately 75% to 85% of all healthcare spending through their clinical decisions, a considerable effort has been made to influence them to make more fiscally-responsible decisions. To this end, managed care and capitated payment schemes have been developed to shift some of the financial risk of patient care from payors to providers.  As a result, cost containment efforts are increasing the management responsibilities of physicians while lowering reimbursement rates.  </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
American HomePatient, based in Franklin, Tennessee, provides care for patients at home.  Its services include respiratory therapy, parenteral and enteral nutrition, and medical equipment and supplies.  The Company has an attractive growth strategy of focusing on smaller markets, building regional density, and growing sales while keeping operating costs low.  We anticipate continued solid revenue, operating, and net income growth as American HomePatient executes this strategy.  Given the strength of the home care stocks in general and the long-term potential for growth acceleration at American HomePatient in particular, we think the stock has a twelve-month price target of $40 and introduce it to coverage as <B>BUY (2)</B>.

<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Demand for home health care is strong and growing.</B> As the population ages, it is getting sicker. Managed care organizations are trying to keep people out of costly hospitals.  Drug and device technology makes it easier to treat people at home, where most people would rather be anyway. We foresee secular growth of 8% to 10% per annum driven by demand.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>American HomePatient has a strong regional focus.</B> The Company is strongest in the lower third of the United States, but makes its acquisitions and builds its new offices around a given geographic area such that anyone looking to buy home care services in that region would have to consider American HomePatient.  The strong regional presence also increases the Company's visibility with managed care referral sources.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>American HomePatient is a successful market consolidator.</B> The Company completed 12 acquisitions in 1994 and 3 in 1995 to date.  It has been successful in integrating these into both the American HomePatient culture and its regional network.  Since the home health business is rapidly consolidating, those companies like American HomePatient that know how to consolidate should do better than the competition.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Hospital joint ventures provide both a source of new business and experience with integrated delivery systems.</B>  American HomePatient currently has six joint ventures in operations with prestigious hospitals in larger markets in their regions and two with Columbia/HCA hospitals.  This gives the hospital both the continuity and control over the quality of total patient care.  These joint ventures are not only sources of revenue, but also give American HomePatient experience with integrated delivery systems - which is where the market is moving.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P><BR>
Apria Healthcare Group is the largest fully-integrated provider of home care services in the United States.   The Company, which resulted from last year's merger between Abbey Healthcare and Homedco Group, has been able to capitalize on its newly achieved operating efficiencies and to continue as a national leader in home care.  By offering respiratory therapy, medical equipment, infusion therapy, and hospice care, the company is seen as a one-stop-shop in the home health care market.  The wide range of services and national scope have put Apria in a very competitive position to win managed care contracts and to succeed in this evolving healthcare environment.  Furthermore, we believe that Apria has the foresight to adapt to the aging of America and to the inherent challenges that will bring for healthcare providers.


<P><BR>
<B><I> Summary Points</I></B>
<P><BR>
<UL><LI><B>Hospice offers a great fit with Apria's core business.</B>   Apria's patients are often quite sick and are being treated for illnesses that will become terminal, such as emphysema.  Doctors, case managers, and health plans that refer patients to home health services also make referrals to hospice.  Hospice patients often need respiratory therapy, intravenous medications, and medical equipment to improve their comfort.  This cross-selling opportunity makes Vitas a great complement to Apria.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Demand for hospice should increase over the next several years.</B>  Besides an aging population, which creates demand for almost all health care services, hospice also should grow as doctors and patients become more aware of the service and focus more on the quality of the end of life, as opposed to the amount of life lived.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Apria's stock is significantly undervalued.</B>  At current prices, Apria is trading at just about thirteen times our 1997 earnings per share estimate of $2.02, which more than adequately discounts risks inherent to the business.  Likewise, it is trading at a discount to other home health care companies.  We think that the market has overlooked the Company's strength.
</UL><P>
<B><I> Risks</I></B>
<P>
<UL><LI><B>The Vitas merger is a lot for Apria to handle on top of the integration of the Abbey-Homedco merger.</B>   While Vitas has shown great revenue growth, its profitability has not been as strong.  Furthermore, it does not have Apria's strong operating procedures.  While Vitas will be a good addition to Apria's revenue mix, it will not be simple to integrate.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Receivables have been increasing.</B>  Apria had receivables days sales outstanding of 123 at the end of the second quarter, which is high but not ridiculously so for a health care service company.  Nevertheless, this is higher than the 113 days posted at the end of 1995.  This is the Company's cheapest source - or most expensive use - of cash.  We feel comfortable with management's ability to bring receivables down but will continue to monitor the levels.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Apria has a high debt level.</B>   Long-term debt to capital is 63.6% on Apria's most recent balance sheet.  Although the interest on this affects Apria's earnings, the Company should be able to operate with few problems.
</UL>

The City of Mesa invites citzens to participate in their local government by getting involved in a citzen advisory board or committee.  Mesa residents contribute to City government by serving on a board and providing direct citizen input and recommendations.  The City, in turn, benefits from their knowledge, experience and expertise.
The "grass roots" level of citizen participation, established through a provision in the Mesa City Charter, helps the Council continue to reflect the aims and desires of the citizens it serves.  The Charter gives the City Council power to create boards or commissions as needed and to specify their powers and duties.  The Mesa City Code also outlines the duties of some boards and committees.
The City recognizes the dedication, hard work and long hours of citizens who volunteer and serve in advisory capacities to the Mayor, Council and City staff.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
ArthroCare Corporation has created a superior product for performing arthroscopic surgery, one of the last great growth markets in the orthopaedics industry.  We expect significant appreciation in ArthroCare's stock over the next year as the company's arthroscopy system is rolled out in the U.S. market and as the product is launched overseas in late 1996.  ArthroCare's system is based on a core technology that simplifies the removal of soft tissue from virtually any part of the body.  We expect this technology to be adapted to several other surgical fields, such as urology, gynecology, dermatology, and periodontics - all of which will add value to the company over time. We are initiating coverage of ArthroCare with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendation and a 12-month price target of $30.   
<P>
<B><I>Introduction</B></I>
<P>
ArthroCare has developed a core technology platform that simplifies the removal of soft tissue from the body.  This technology, which has broad patent protection, has applications in several fields of medicine, including orthopaedics, urology, gynecology, dermatology, and periodontics.  ArthroCare's technology is a versatile, easy-to-use electrosurgery system that ablates (removes) tissue while simultaneously achieving hemostasis, or the sealing of small bleeding vessels.  The dual function of the system shortens procedure time and reduces the number of surgical tools used in each procedure and thus can save procedure costs.
<P>
ArthroCare's lead product is the Arthroscopic System, an innovative product used to perform arthroscopic surgery a common form of surgery to repair damaged tissue within human joints.  Arthroscopy involves the use of several small instruments, some to visualize, and others to remove tissue in tight, closed areas of the body most commonly the knee and shoulder.  ArthroCare's system consists of three elements: a radio frequency controller, a connecting cable, and a disposable bipolar probe. The company received 510(k) clearance for the first version of the product, the Arthroscopic System, in March of 1995 and shipments began in December.
<P>
Arthroscopy is the single most commonly performed surgical procedure in the U.S., and we estimate that approximately 2.3 million of these procedures were performed in the U.S. in 1995.  That represents an annual market opportunity in the U.S. of more than $260 million for the disposable component of ArthroCare's product alone.
<P>
Arthroscopy is one of the few categories within the orthopaedics market that is showing double-digit sales growth.  We expect the rate of growth to continue at its present level or even to accelerate somewhat due to the aging population, America's predilection for exercise and recreational athletics that can lead to injured joints, and the availability of enabling technologies such as the ArthroCare system that make more procedures possible in such tough-to-access joints as the shoulder, elbow, and ankle.
<P>
ArthroCare's product is the most exciting new entry in the field of arthroscopy since the technique was introduced in the late 1970s; in fact, we think the ArthroCare system is one of the most innovative new products in the entire orthopaedics industry today.  We expect ArthroCare's product to grow at a dramatically faster pace than the overall arthroscopy market as it supplants existing arthroscopic surgery tools (mechanical, motorized, single-electrode electrosurgical devices, and lasers) and as it possibly expands the number of procedures that can be performed arthroscopically.  We expect the Arthroscopic System to be the sole source of ArthroCare's sales until late 1997.
<P>
ArthroCare's technology entails a razor/razor blades approach.  The capital components include a radio-frequency energy power controller and connecting cable, which together sell for approximately $12,500.  The disposable component is a bipolar, multielectrode catheter, or wand, which carries a list price of $120.
<P>
One of the company's major strengths is that it relies on a 510(k) regulatory strategy:  Currently, all of the intended applications of the technology are likely to be cleared for U.S. sale under this shorter regulatory pathway.  This strategy limits the company's regulatory risks and speeds up the time it takes to get products to market. Exhibit 1 lists ArthroCare's initial target markets and the regulatory and commercial status of each.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P></P>
Ascend Communications' core skills and responsiveness to customer needs have made it one of the leading vendors in the fast-growing wide area network (WAN) access market, which includes Internet and intranet access, remote LAN access, telecommuting and video-conferencing. We think that the company, with its proven and innovative products, will continue to benefit from the growth in Internet infrastructure, where it has established a very strong position, and from the growing trend by corporations to build intranets and other networks to link their branch offices and telecommuters. 
<P></P>
We expect these trends to result in strong revenue and earnings growth and think that the stock could trade at between 50-55 times the FY:97 estimate of $1.04. This suggests a 12-month price target of $52-57. Therefore, we are initiating coverage with a <B>BUY(2)</B> rating.
<P></P>

<I><B>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>The market for wide area network (WAN) access products will continue its explosive growth. These products are used in some of the fastest-growing areas of the networking industry, including Internet and intranet access, remote local area network (LAN) access, telecommuting and videoconferencing.
</UL><BR><UL>
<LI>Ascend Communications is the leading vendor in this fast-growing market and an important innovator in LAN-WAN access. The company offers a broad range of high-speed WAN access products that support leased lines as well as switched services like ISDN and frame relay. Ascend is the pioneer and market leader in inverse multiplexing, a WAN technology that offers users a simple alternative to expensive leased lines. The company's line of innovative products have helped it become the leading supplier of digital access products to nearly all of the world's major providers of Internet access. 
</UL><BR><UL>
<LI>The Company has a powerful multichannel distribution network that includes key telecom carriers, major Internet service providers and leading value-added resellers. We think that Ascend's relationships with companies such as AT&T, KDD of Japan, UUNET and Annixter provide important channels for its products, and allow the company to track WAN technologies and rapidly evolving customers needs. We also expect the company to benefit as telecom carriers become more interested in offering Internet and intranet services.
</UL><BR><UL>
<LI>Ascend is making strong inroads into fast-growing international markets, especially Japan and Europe. Users in these regions have access to a broad range of high-speed WAN access services, especially ISDN. Ascend's products have become widely accepted because they support different WAN technologies and are certified by domestic telecom carriers for use in their markets. The company has been getting its products certified for major overseas markets since 1991, and we think Ascend's proven products and expertise in penetrating these markets will continue to provide an important edge against competitors, particularly the traditional LAN vendors.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P><BR>

AXENT is a leading supplier of security management software and services for enterprise-wide client/server networks. Currently, AXENT is selling at a P/E multiple of 50.5 times our 1997 EPS estimate,  in-line with the group average of 49.3 times. This valuation does not factor in any meaningful contribution from Enterprise SignOn (ESO), a product expected to be commercially available in late 1996.  We believe that ESO could be a major home-run product that could propel AXENT's revenue and earnings growth through the end of the decade.  We rate the stock a <B>BUY (2)</B> with a conservative 12-month price target of $26.75.
<P><BR>

<B><I>The Company</B></I><BR>
<P><BR>
AXENT develops, markets, and supports enterprise-wide information security solutions for client/server computing environments.  As organizations migrate from centralized computing platforms to distributed, heterogeneous client/server environments accessible from both internal networks and external networks, like the Internet, they need comprehensive security solutions. AXENT addresses these needs. The Company's OmniGuard family of software products enables organizations to centrally define and manage information security across a variety of client/server platforms, operating systems, and communications protocols.  The Company's software products also provide and enhance data confidentiality, access control, user administration, and intrusion detection functions.   
<P><BR>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<P><BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Opportunity.</B> As client/server networks increasingly expand around mainframe and UNIX-based computer systems, enterprises are becoming increasingly vulnerable to breaches of security, and the theft and damage of critical information because information assets are now scattered across far-flung networks of desktops and servers.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>
Rapidly Growing Market.</B> The market for security management software and services, currently in its early stages, is undergoing rapid expansion. Within this market, more than 400 companies sell a broad range of security hardware and software products. We estimate that Axent's current addressable market is $100-200 million, with a growth rate of 45% projected for the next several years.   </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>
Broad Product Offering.</B> AXENT has developed a comprehensive suite of software that supports multiple phases of information security management across multiple computers and operating systems. In contrast, AXENT's competitors primarily sell a single product, usually an access-control product.  </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>
New Products.</B> AXENT's aggressive new-product-development plan will dramatically expand the platform coverage of its products.  By Q4:96, the Company is expected to have its three primary products operational on all major operating systems, including Windows 95 and Windows NT.  In addition, AXENT is in the pilot phase with an advanced single sign-on product, ESO, which we believe could significantly expand revenues and earnings through the end of the decade.  </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>
World-Class Customer Base.</B> AXENT has an impressive customer base of major technology, telecommunications and financial services firms, as well as other organizations.  Currently, the Company serves approximately 150 customers including Motorola, MCI, and Wells Fargo. These organizations have large, complex distributed networks of computers.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>	
An Experienced Management Team.</B> The AXENT management team is made up of proven, successful software professionals.  Each has substantial experience in the software business and has been part of the team that has created the vibrant AXENT out of a stagnant  Raxco DEC VAX system-utility business.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>
Strong Revenue  and EPS Growth.</B> We expect AXENT to produce strong revenue and EPS growth through the end of the decade.  Without factoring in the potential of ESO, we expect revenues to increase 43% in 1996, and a further 45% in 1997;  EPS are projected to increase in 1996 to $0.20 (from a loss of $0.30 in 1995), and to $0.33 in 1997, an increase of 67%.</UL>

<center><h3>Airport Overview</h3></center>
<p><strong>Falcon Field Airport </strong>is located in Mesa, Arizona and is
only seven miles northeast of downtown Mesa and 18 miles from Phoenix. Falcon Field Airport, named after the British hunting bird, got its start during the early stages of World War II, when the United States agreed to help train combat pilots for the British Royal Air Force.  Arizona's dry climate and wide open spaces made it an obvious choice for training of both air and ground troops.  The airfield officially opened September, 1941 with the first training flight of a Boeing PT-17 &quot;Stearman&quot; biplane.  When the war ended, Falcon Field was turned over to the city of Mesa and has become one of the 10 largest airports in the United States in terms of based aircraft.  
<p>
The airport currently serves as home base for more than 800 aircraft, as an industrial park with more than 30 aviation-related businesses, and more than 50 commercial enterprises.  One of the largest tenants on the airport is McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems, whose $40 million assembly plant and testing facility is located on 190 acres just north of the airport.  McDonnell Douglas is one of the world's leading designers and builders of helicopters for civil and military use.  The Notar and Apache helicopters are produced at this plant.</p>

<p>Falcon Field Airport has more than 350 general aviation hangars, covered tiedown facilities for more than 100 general aviation aircraft, and more than 200 open tiedown spaces.  The airport is a perfect site for one or more major employers.  It can easily accommodate mixed-use industrial sites, including warehousing, light manufacturing and other activity.  Falcon Field has two parallel runways.  With more than 300 days of sunshine per year, Falcon Field is one of the most popular Southwest destinations for general aviation travelers.

<center><h3>Economic Impact of Falcon Field</h3></center>
<p>
Falcon Field Airport is a catalyst for economic growth and development in Arizona.  It supports the area's business centers and tourist attractions which in turn provide local employment opportunities. 
<P>
The direct economic impact of Falcon Field Airport was $276.6 million in 1991.  The airport created employment for 4,134 workers, who brought home payrolls of $196.2 million.
<p>
The total economic impact of Falcon Field includes all "multiplier" effects that accumulate as direct spending recirculates through the economy.  Accounting for all multiplier effects, the 1991 total economic impact of Falcon Field was $751 million.  Overall, 11,700 jobs were supported in the East Valley area by the presence of the airport.  On a daily basis, the airport created a revenue stream of economic activity that exceeded <strong>$2 million</strong> per day in 1991.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Biofield Corp. has developed a revolutionary way to diagnose breast cancer with a fast, noninvasive, objective method of distinguishing between cancerous and benign tissue. This patented technology may also be applied to breast cancer screening, as well as to detection of other forms of cancer. Over the next year, Biofield should achieve several milestones, including filing a premarket approval (PMA) application to begin U.S. marketing review of the lead product and a rollout of that product in Europe. We think these and other events will lead to significant appreciation in the stock. We are initiating coverage of Biofield with a <B>BUY (2)</B> recommendation and a 12-month price target of $17.
<P>
<B><I>Introduction</I></B>
<P>
For women, breast cancer is the most prevalent and most feared of all cancers. It is certainly the most common form of cancer among women, and the number two killer of women in the United States - surpassed only by cardiovascular disease. According to the National Cancer Institute, this year in the United States alone more than 182,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 46,000 will die from the condition. Early detection and treatment are essential to improve a woman's chances for beating the disease.
<P>
Biofield Corp.'s lead product, the Biofield Diagnostic System, provides a revolutionary way to diagnose breast cancer. The system offers an immediate, objective, and noninvasive way to determine whether a lesion identified by mammography or physical examination is cancerous or benign.
<P>
There is an urgent need for a technology such as Biofield's. The FDA has granted expedited review status to the Biofield device, and we are conservatively estimating that it will take 12 to 16 months from the time the company submits its PMA application until U.S. marketing approval is granted. Our projections call for U.S. approval of the Biofield system in late 1997 or early 1998.
<P>
In September 1995, Biofield completed a large multicenter clinical trial of the device at eight leading European medical centers. The study was unblinded in December 1995, and the results were excellent. The system proved to be effective in discriminating between benign and malignant breast lesions. Malignant and premalignant lesions were identified as cancers approximately 90% of the time. 
<P>
The outcome of the European study has profound implications for breast cancer management. We expect the results of the study to be submitted for publication in a prestigious peer-reviewed medical journal during 1996. The publication of these results is likely to attract worldwide attention from the news media and women's health groups.
<P>
We also expect Biofield to enter into European strategic alliances before the end of the year. We anticipate that these alliances will be substantial deals for Biofield, going far beyond basic distribution arrangements. A likely model for these agreements is the relationships UroMed Corp. entered into with various European companies.  Those multiyear marketing pacts brought in cash up-front to UroMed in addition to considerable spending commitments from the European companies to support sales and promotional efforts for the UroMed product.
<P>
Biofield completed enrollment in its U.S. pivotal trial in early March. The study focused on 1,320 women at six leading U.S. institutions. The data are being analyzed now, and we target PMA submission in the third quarter of this year. Under the FDA's expedited review policies, we think the Biofield Diagnostic System can win approval within 12 to 16 months of submission. With that schedule, Biofield would launch the product in the U.S. in late 1997 or early 1998.
<P>
<I><B>Key Investment Points</B></I>
<UL><LI><B>
Focus on breast cancer/women's health ensures visibility.</B>  Biofield's technology could revolutionize the diagnosis of breast cancer while saving significant costs for the healthcare system.  Breast cancer is one of the most visible and politically charged areas of public health.  The news media should be all over the Biofield story as published data become available.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Enormous, underserved markets.</B>  In the U.S. alone, 49 million breast cancer screening exams are performed each year.  Approximately eight million require some form of diagnostic examination, including approximately 750,000 breast biopsies.  All current forms of screening and diagnosis have significant drawbacks, either in terms of accuracy of test results or costs associated with the procedure.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Proven efficacy.</B>  The European multicenter study of more than 660 women demonstrated that the Biofield Diagnostic System is highly effective at differentiating between benign and malignant lesions.  Enrollment in the U.S. multicenter trial was completed during the first quarter of 1996.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Proprietary technology platform.</B>  Biofield's technology can theoretically be used in the screening and diagnosis of not only breast cancer but of a variety of cancers that arise in epithelial cells, including skin, prostate, ovarian, colon, and endometrium.  The company has six issued U.S. patents relating to the products and technology, and several pending.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Razor/razor blade revenue model.</B>  Biofield's first product, the Biofield Diagnostic System, consists of two parts: the controller, which will carry a capital expense of approximately $20,000-25,000, and the ZEROSET single-use disposable sensors, which will be priced at approximately $100-160 per set.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Strong management.</B>  Newly appointed CEO Ken Anstey is well known and highly respected on Wall Street and within the medical device industry.  Anstey was previously the CEO of Mitek Surgical, the very successful bone anchor company.  During his tenure at Mitek, Anstey guided the company as it established suture anchors as the gold standard for soft tissue reattachment, as it made a successful transition to a direct salesforce, as it completed an important acquisition of a new technology platform, and as the company was ultimately sold to Johnson & Johnson for a hefty premium to its market capitalization.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Capstone is a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and prisons.  The Company monitors drug use and patient care to improve the health of institutional residents and to assist nursing homes in complying with federal and state regulations.  With the recent acquisition of the Symphony Pharmacy Services division of Integrated Health Services, Capstone is now the third-largest provider of nursing home pharmacy services.  However, the Company has only a 5% share of this fragmented market.  We are introducing Capstone to coverage with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> rating and a price target of $18, based on a 30% long-term growth rate and 1998 earnings per share estimate of $0.61.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Demographic trends favor Capstone.</B>  The general aging of the population generates demand for nursing home care, which in turn creates demand for specialized institutional pharmacy services.  The prison business also benefits as more inmates, sent away for longer terms, age within the prison system.  Both businesses are price controlled, giving Capstone the experience to compete in a continually-changing environment for health care reimbursement.
</UL><UL><LI><B>The prison business is an excellent source of cash flow.</B>  Capstone provides pharmaceuticals for 115,000 prison inmates around the United States.  This is under 7% of revenue and declining as a percentage of the total business, but it represents a stable source of cash to finance the growth of Capstone's nursing home pharmacy business.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Regulation generates increased demand for services.</B>  Government at the state and federal levels is increasing its scrutiny of nursing homes, placing those companies providing value-added services in an excellent position to grow by helping nursing homes maintain high-quality care.  Despite proposed changes in federal law, Congress probably does not have the stomach to repeal the regulations now in place, returning nursing homes to a more dismal state.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Capstone is a market consolidator.</B>  Compared to smaller, fragmented competitors that cannot adequately compete in the tightly-regulated environment, Capstone is ahead of the game.  Having demonstrated its ability to make acquisitions, it can grow by doing more.  The Company currently has a 5% market share nationally; Omnicare, the largest player, has only a 15% share.
</UL><UL><LI><B>The Company is in a great position to show margin expansion.</B>  We are expecting gross margins to expand from the 36.7% reported in the second quarter of 1996 to 39.6% for the full year 1996, 42.5% for the year 1997, and 43.0% for the year 1998.  This improvement will come as the Company changes its geographic mix (New York, a major market for Capstone, has lower prescription reimbursement than many other states), improves its volume purchasing power, and adds higher-margin infusion and medical supplies revenue to the existing customer base.</UL>
<B><I>Risks</B></I><P>
<UL><LI><B>The Company is in the midst of an operational turn around.</B>  Capstone was formed when Counsel Corporation invested in Choice Drug, and Choice merged with Premier Pharmacy.  The Company thus has a different management and capital structure than it did in the Choice days.  The progress to date has been great, but any major turn around like this carries the risk that it will not be completed easily.
</UL><UL><LI><B>The Integrated acquisition could be difficult to digest.</B>  The acquisition more than doubles Capstone's size in terms of revenue, geography, and headcount.  Incorporating it will not be a simple task.  Fortunately, Capstone's management has a great track record of making and integrating acquisitions.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Much of Capstone's near-term growth will be acquired.</B>  The Company has a transaction-driven history and a stated acquisition-based strategy, which carries with it the risk of acquiring a mistake.  A related, although not as serious, risk is that the timing of an acquisition can cause lumpiness in earnings and carries the possibility of a missed earnings estimate. 
</UL><UL><LI><B>Nursing home pharmacy is becoming more competitive.</B>  As the market consolidates and the competitors become more professional, Capstone will face a more difficult competitive environment.  Service, already extremely important, will become even more so, making it imperative that the company continues to be a top operator.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P><BR> CardioVascular Dynamics, Inc. (CVD) is a technology leader in the fast growing interventional cardiology market.  CVD's catheter-based technologies offer solutions to the biggest clinical challenges confronting interventional cardiology today.  CVD's products are highly proprietary.  In fact, the company's patented Focus balloon catheters offer the safest and most effective way to perform angioplasty and to deploy stents within blood vessels.  CVD's products also offer greater ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness because multiple functions can be combined on a single catheter.  CVD has more than 40 FDA-approved products and a rich R&D pipeline.  Sales are growing at a torrid pace, and we project that the company will reach profitability in the first quarter of 1997.  We expect several milestones over the next year to provoke intense investor interest in the stock. We are initiating coverage of CVD with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendation and a 12-month price target of $19.


<P><BR>
<B><I> Introduction</I></B>
<P><BR>
We expect CVD to emerge over the next few years as a major force in the field of interventional cardiology - a growing, technology-driven $2 billion annual market.  While a relative newcomer to the bustling market for the treatment of atherosclerosis, or clogged arteries, CVD's advanced catheter-based products are in the forefront of efforts to improve the outcomes of interventional procedures - to reduce or eliminate the most common complications of treatment, and to reduce the cost of treatment in the process.  We think CVD's highly differentiated catheter-based technologies will allow it to compete successfully against the giants of the interventional cardiology industry by offering superior performance characteristics and cost savings.
<P>
CVD's Focus technology may represent the most significant improvement in balloon angioplasty systems since the category was invented in the late 1970s.  CVD's Focus balloon catheters have the potential to revolutionize the way physicians treat atherosclerosis.  Focus balloons offer the safest way to apply therapeutic radial force within clogged arteries by providing effective therapy without causing the damage to the lining of the vessel wall associated with conventional balloons.  CVD's Focus catheters have the potential to become the standard of care, and to be used in a high percentage of balloon angioplasties performed worldwide. 
<P>
CVD's products are also designed to be used for such specialized procedures as stent delivery, perfusion, and site-specific delivery of therapeutic agents such as drugs or radioactive materials.  Equally important, CVD's technology permits multiple functions to be combined on a single catheter, making procedures faster and easier to perform, and thereby reducing equipment costs.  For example, the same Focus catheter used to perform the primary intervention - the dilation of the vessel - can also be used to deploy a stent or to deliver a dose of drug to the site of the treatment.  In addition, CVD offers a line of vascular access products, which allow rapid and accurate access to veins and arteries in interventional and emergency procedures.
<P>
CVD has tremendous momentum behind its product development and commercialization efforts.  In the past 18 months, CVD has had more than 40 products approved by the FDA - an all-time record within the entire medical devices industry.  To date, CVD has launched only eight of these products.  Over the next 12 to 18 months the company will launched several additional products as it aggressively expands manufacturing capacity and builds a direct salesforce in the U.S.  CVD will use some of the proceeds from its recent initial public offering for this expansion effort. 
<P>
Our models assume that CVD, as it expands its manufacturing capacity, will launch two or three new products each quarter during the next two years.  We are projecting a compound sales growth rate of 108% over the next 4 years: to $9.3 million in 1996, $30.1 million in 1997, $52.1 million in 1998, and $77 million in 1999.  CVD reported a loss of $971 million, or $0.25 per share, in 1994. That loss widened to $2.9 million, or $0.65 per share, in 1995 as the company increased its spending to support manufacturing expansion and the intensification of its R&D effort. We project that CVD's loss will narrow to $1.5 million, or $0.22 per share in FY:96.  We expect the company to turn profitable in the first quarter of 1997, and our earnings estimates are $2.6 million, or $0.24 per share, in 1997; $7.5 million, or $0.80 per share, in 1998; and $14.2 million, or $1.52, in 1999.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
The population of elderly people within the United States is rapidly expanding and will continue to grow as the baby boomers reach retirement.  This aging of the population has and will have a profound effect on the healthcare industry, especially on the payment processes for elderly care and on the kind of services that are available.  Several companies are poised to benefit from these transitions. We believe Apria Healthcare, American HomePatient and Home Health Corporation of America in the home health industry, as well as Omnicare, and Vitalink in the institutional pharmacy services market are in a position to benefit from changes in the healthcare reimbursement system.  Each of these companies has forged new paths in the geriatric services area.

<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B> Aging population will drive demand for specialized healthcare services. </B>  The U.S. population is aging rapidly.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people 65 and over was 33.2 million in 1994 and is expected to more than double to 70.2 million by 2030.  This ever expanding oldest age group will demand services specific to their needs.  
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> The demise of Medicare.</B>  Arcane Medicare regulations have restricted the types of care available and encouraged inefficiency.  As managed care continues to permeate our society, the inefficiencies of the current Medicare system are likely to become anachronistic.  Medicare beneficiaries will either become part of a managed care organization or choose to remove themselves from the system altogether.  Companies with creative, cost-effective services that appeal to senior citizens and HMOs, not to government bureaucrats, will be the winners in this new world order.

</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Focusing on caring. </B> Traditional medicine's emphasis on preventive and curative methods has led to increased life expectancy.  With people living longer, medical care for the oldest people will be aimed at improving their quality of life.  For some providers, this shift from curing to caring will be a radical departure from their training and philosophy.</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Successful companies will take into account the special needs of the elderly. </B> As we age our metabolism changes, we often become frail, and can develop any number of medical conditions.  Despite a generally slower pace, we still want to lead full productive lives without being a burden to our family and friends.  Companies that provide high-quality, cost-effective care while respecting our needs as well as our families' will succeed in today's competitive healthcare industry and become industry leaders.
</UL>


<P></P>
<B><I>Emerging Trends</I></B>
<P>
As companies currently involved in the area attempt to map out their futures, and change and consolidation become commonplace, we see four emerging trends:
	<P><UL><LI>
<B>Increased Integration.</B>  Medicare and other insurance systems will be much more closely linked.
	
	<P><LI>
<B>Increased Role of Nurses.</B>  Doctors are trained to cure, but most of the conditions of aging are not curable.  Nurses, on the other hand, are trained to care.  They may be in a better position to help people cope comfortably with degenerative conditions, improving the quality of life for elderly patients.
	<P><LI>
<B>New Services Developing. </B>  As we learn more about caring for geriatric patients with chronic conditions, and as families look to cope with the burden of caring for an older relative, we see new types of congregate care, day centers, assisted living, home health, monitoring, and other services emerging.  They will increasingly appeal to a private pay or managed care market, as Medicare becomes increasingly irrelevant.
	<P>	
<LI>
<B>A Continuum of Care.</B>  Doctors, pharmacists, case workers, and home health providers have to communicate more effectively to avoid costly overlaps and conflicting advice which can increase hospitalization rates and higher costs.  More facilities are attempting to integrate their services to provide better patient care and avoid potentially hazardous mishaps.</UL>
<P></P>
<B><I> And the Winner Is...</I></B>
<P>

The expanding geriatric population has lead to a gradual, but ever-increasing, awareness of its particular needs.  As the geriatric segment continues to grow, many companies will find themselves in a position to benefit from the changes in the healthcare system we have outlined above.  The characteristics of the successful companies of tomorrow include:
	<P>
<UL><LI><B>    Creativity.</B>  They will be able to develop new services and adapt to the changing market (which, truth be told, is only beginning to learn about geriatric care).
		<P>
<LI><B>Sensitivity. </B> Geriatric care is a service business with two customers, the patient and the family.  Caring for older people involves respecting their humanity and their accomplishments over the years.  They are in no way very old children, just as children are not very small adults.  Complicating the issue is family relationships, which may be tested when children are forced to care for parents or a spouse has to give up dreams of an active retirement to care for someone who is sick.  This can bring up feelings of guilt and resentment.  A provider will have to deal with the patients and families, and do so well, in order to succeed.
	<P>	
<LI><B>Adaptability.</B>  Medicare will change, but it is uncertain how.  In our opinion, companies that focus on managed care will do best, not only because Medicare will probably go toward a managed care model, but also because experience with the different managed care payment mechanisms (capitation, case rate, per diem, bonus and penalty, etc.) will be useful experience for handling whatever scheme Medicare should choose to use.
	<P>
<LI><B> Favoritism.</B>  Women have longer life expectancies than men - of those over 65 the sex ratio in 1994 was 146/100 women to men.  This ratio increases with age, topping off at 259/100 for those 85 and older.  Women in this oldest group are less likely to still be married, and will need additional support.  In 1994 only 43% of elderly women were married, 47% were widows, and 40% of noninstitutionalized women were living alone, compared to 77%, 13%, and 16% respectively for men. </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B><BR><P>
Carnegie Group is a systems integration firm that uses advanced software technologies to provide solutions to clients' complex business problems.  In our opinion, the Company's stock is undervalued compared to a broad list of comparable companies.  The average P/E multiple on CY96 EPS estimates for comparable system integrators is 30.9; 90.7% higher than the Carnegie Group's P/E multiple.  We think this valuation gap is not based on fundamentals; rather, we believe it reflects Carnegie's short time in the public market, relative to comparable companies.  Carnegie Group's well-defined growth strategy has created a defensible market postion.  Further, the high service-content of its business decreases the potential for EPS volatility.  Based on these factors, we think Carnegie Group stock merits a P/E multiple similar to that of its peers.  Our 12-month target stock price of $17.75 is based on a conservative P/E of 25 times our FY97 EPS of $0.71 (a discount to the group CY96 P/E of 30.9).  We rate the stock a <B>BUY(2)</B>.

<BR><P>
<B><I>Summary Points</I></B>
<P></P>
<UL><LI><I>Carnegie's sophisticated software solutions enhance business processes.</I>  Within the computer services industry, Carnegie specializes in knowledge-based software solutions that improve client productivity and competitive position.  CGIX focuses on customer contact, customer service, logistics, planning, and scheduling applications.  The Company targets its services to clients in the telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, and defense industries.</UL>
<BR><UL><LI>
<I>Large and growing market.</I> The computer services business is a multibillion dollar industry that incorporates a wide range of products and services.  Carnegie Group focuses on the design and delivery of new client server applications to its customers.  This market segment is estimated to be $7.0 billion with growth in the 30-50% range.  Further refinement of CGIX's market opportunity involves sizing the market for advanced software technology solutions, which we estimate to be in the $100-200 million range, also with a 30-50% growth rate.  Considering the overall size of the software services market and the Company's unique software skills, we think Carnegie Group has virtually unlimited potential for long-term growth.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>Limited competition.</I> Carnegie Group experiences limited competition due to the specialized nature of its skills and focus on cutting-edge applications.  Overall the Company wins 70% of the deals it bids on.  The most frequent competitor is the internal MIS group.  Carnegie Group is highly effective against these competitors because of its proven rapid application development practice, and the delivery of "on target" solutions that are rarely matched by MIS departments.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>Risk factors.</I> Carnegie's primary risk factor is reliance on a few large customers for a significant percentage of revenue.  During the past four years, the Company has derived 73-92% of revenue from its top five customers.  However, the Company has demonstrated a track record of maintaining long-term business relationships with key customers, which often means multiple contracts with those clients.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>Strong revenue and EPS growth.</I> We think Carnegie Group can grow revenue and earnings in the 30-35% range over the next few years.  Margins should expand toward the 15% level within the next two to three years due to leverage of the existing sales and adminstrative infrasturcutre.  The Company entered 1996 with approximately 58% of 1996 service revenue in backlog.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>CGIX's price target makes it an attractive investment.</I> At current prices, CGIX stock is selling at a P/E multiple of 16.2 times our 1996 EPS estimate of $0.53.  This multiple is in contrast with a comparable group average of 30.9 times 1996 consensus estimates.  We think our 12-month price target of $17 3/4, (25x our 1997 estimate of $0.71) makes CGIX stock an attractive investment opportunity.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<BR><P>
We think Checkfree Corporation will be a leader in providing electronic commerce products and services for consumers, businesses, and financial institutions.  Based on the enormous electronic commerce market potential, and our belief that Checkfree will be a significant long-term participant in the market, we are initiating coverage with a <B>BUY (2)</B> recommendation and a 12-month price target of $23.50. 
<BR><P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>A leading player in the large and growing electronic commerce market. </B>Checkfree's products and services enable its customers, which include consumers, businesses, and financial institutions, to make electronic payments and collections, and to generally automate and simplify paper-based financial transactions.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Large, unpenetrated market opportunity.</B>  Approximately 60 billion checks will be written in 1995, 30 billion by consumers.  Today less than 1% of consumer bills are paid electronically.  If 33% of all checks were paid electronically, this would create a $6 billion market opportunity.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Experienced, motivated management team. </B> Senior management has a collective 31 years of experience working at Checkfree and owns 26% of the Company.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Strategic alliances for distribution. </B> Checkfree has partners to reach each of these market segments including (among others) AT&T for consumers (60 million U.S. households), Automatic Data Processing for businesses (200,000 business customers) and MasterCard for financial institutions.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Internet product opportunity. </B> Checkfree has just introduced the Checkfree Wallet, which enables secure, point-of-sale Internet transactions.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Platform independent, open systems architecture. </B> Checkfree bill payment services operate on both PC's and Macintosh platforms, which are currently installed in approximately 35 million households.  In addition, future services will be accessible using telephones, screen hones, and interactive television.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Affordable, competitively priced service.</B>  Checkfree charges a majority of its customers $9.95 per month, but in conjunction with its new marketing play with AT&T, has recently introduced a lower priced service at $5.95 per month for 20 checks, cheaper than postage at $6.50.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Recurring revenue model. </B> Both consumers and businesses pay for services on a monthly basis.  Consumer churn rate was only 14% in the last year.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Growth vs. profitability, operating leverage with scale.</B>  We expect revenue to grow at a compound rate of approximately 40% from $48.8 million in 1995 to $260 million in 2000.  To generate the new customers necessary to achieve this growth rate, we expect Checkfree to invest heavily in sales and marketing, resulting in a small net loss in each of the next few years.  Ultimately, as Checkfree captures a meaningful share of an expanding market and realizes efficiencies from handling a large number of transactions, we believe Checkfree can be very profitable with a target 25% operating margin.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Valuation.</B>  Based on the enormous potential for Internet electronic commerce and Checkfree's opportunity to establish itself as the market leader, we are initiating a coverage with a <B>BUY (2)</B> rating and a 12-month price target of $23.50.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Cisco Systems' leading position in large corporate networks and the Internet, coupled with its track record of successfully entering new markets, is likely to result in continued strong revenue and earnings growth. We rate the stock <B>BUY(2)</B> and think that it could trade at around 30 times the CY97 EPS estimate of $3.49, which suggests a 12-month price target of $105 a share.
<P></P>
<B><I>Summary Points</I></B>

<UL>
<LI>Fundamentals for the networking industry remain outstanding.  The dynamic growth of the past decade will continue unabated, driven by the expansion of the Internet and by companies building and upgrading their local- and wide-area networks (LANs and WANs).
</UL>
<UL><BR><LI>
Cisco Systems is the leading vendor in this fast-growing market. The company offers the broadest line of networking products, ranging from routers to newer ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and LAN switches, that connect and manage communications over LANs and WANs.
</UL>
<UL><BR><LI>The company's products are at the core of many of the world's largest networks, and its customer base includes virtually all the major corporations. Cisco's loyal customer base will most likely select the company's switching products as they upgrade their shared-media networks with LAN and ATM switches. The company provides these customers with a coherent strategy for migrating from shared to switched-networks.

</UL>
<UL><BR><LI>The company's proven high-end router technology will help it maintain its lead in the internetworking marketplace. LAN switching and routing are technologies that complement each other, especially in large multi-protocol networks. These complex networks still require sophisticated routers for traffic management, WAN access and security. Also, more than 80% of the routers that connect the Internet come from Cisco. The explosive growth of the Internet will continue driving the demand for these proven workhorses. 
</UL>
<UL><BR><LI>Cisco is continually adapting its core internetworking technology for uses in other networking markets, such as ISDN, telco networks and two-way cable TV.  Once the company identifies new markets, it is pragmatic enough to enter them rapidly by acquiring innovative companies, investing in others and by building alliances when necessary.

Comshare is the leading vendor of decision support application software and should benefit from explosive interest in data analysis and the rapidly growing data warehouse market.  Based on strong sales, a full-service product line, and CSRE's close relationship with leading multidimensional database vendor Arbor Software, we think Comshare can sustain long-term EPS growth in the 30% range.  Comshare stock is currently valued at 23.6x our CY96 EPS estimate of $0.96 compared with an average of 63.8x for the comparable group of companies.  Our 12-month price target of $31 is based on a P/E of 25x our CY97 EPS estimate of $1.25.  We rate the stock a <B>BUY (2)</B>.

<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Corporations are analyzing data to make better business decisions.</I> Comshare's  products address the growing data warehousing and decision support software market.  One of the greatest challenges facing organizations today is not collecting and managing data but rather accessing, analyzing and using this valuable information to produce a competitive advantage.  Explosive corporate interest in data analysis is fueling growth for companies with products that help build data warehouses and software that helps access and analyze this data.  
</UL>
<BR><UL><LI><I>Corporate resource allocation for decision support and data warehousing products is growing.</I> Independent market research indicates corporations are investing heavily in these data warehousing and decision support products.  To optimize the business value of their data, corporations are turning to data warehousing technology to store different forms of information in a way that is easily accessible using decision support and other kinds of software.  Comshare is a leading participant in this market.
</UL><BR>
<UL><LI><I>Market growth should be dramatic with numerous participants.</I> This market continues to grow as companies increasingly allocate resources to data warehousing and decision support, and software companies introduce products that effectively address the needs of these companies (see Growth Stock Review, November 1995).  A recent development driving market growth is software that incorporates OLAP (on-line analytical processing) multidimensional database technology.  This software decreases the time it takes to access data and offers end-users flexibility when working with data.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>Comshare products address this growing market.</I> Comshare offers complete decision support solutions and distinguishes itself by emphasizing total business solutions rather than specific tools or technology. The Company provides customized applications in the general decision support, financial and retailing vertical market segments. To reduce product development risk and reduce time to market, Comshare leverages third-party technologies such as Arbor Software's Essbase OLAP engine.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>EPS growth should outpace revenue growth and margins should improve.</I> We think CSRE can grow revenue in the 15-20% range over the next few years. However, EPS should grow in the 30% range driven by 25-30% growth in license revenue and margin improvement as the Company leverages its existing sales and service infrastructure.  This growth will also be driven by Comshare's large, attractive customer base of over 3,000 corporations worldwide.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
<I>Price target makes CSRE an attractive investment.</I> Currently, CSRE stock is selling at a P/E multiple of 23.6x our CY96 EPS estimate of $0.96. This contrasts with a comparable company group average of 63.8x CY96 consensus EPS estimates.  We think our 12-month price target of $31 (25x our CY97 EPS estimate of $1.25) makes CSRE stock an attractive investment opportunity.</UL>

<P>
CONNECT designs, develops, and supports industrial strength, scalable application software for Internet-based electronic commerce.  CONNECT's software enables businesses to quickly, securely, and cost-effectively implement a fully automated sales, marketing and distribution channel on the Internet - a "virtual sales channel."  CONNECT is well positioned to take advantage of the explosive projected growth in interactive online commerce, which we believe will lead to long-term revenue growth of 50%.  Accordingly, we are initiating coverage of CONNECT with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendation and a 12-month price target of $12.

<P>
<B><I> Summary </B></I><P>
<UL><LI><B>
CONNECT is a leading provider of interactive electronic commerce software.</B> CONNECT provides a comprehensive Internet-based solution that enables businesses to quickly, securely, and cost-effectively implement a fully automated sales, marketing, and distribution channel on the World Wide Web.  This "virtual sales channel" is intended to complement direct and indirect sales channels already in place and can be easily integrated with existing enterprise systems and business processes.<P>
The Company's software supports all key functions necessary for large-scale interactive commerce, including user registration, multimedia catalog and content management, dynamic merchandising, order capture and management, security, payment processing, enterprise integration, and systems administration.  CONNECT's highly scalable solution is designed for high-capacity interactive commerce, and is therefore capable of supporting large numbers of purchasers, products, and transactions. </UL><P>
<UL><LI><B>
Explosive growth in Internet-based electronic commerce.</B> To date, Web sites have primarily been utilized for customer service and collateral marketing efforts.  However, as companies begin to envision the World Wide Web as a potential source of revenue, they are rapidly adding interactive, targeted marketing features and transaction capabilities to their Web sites.  We estimate that over 60% of large Web sites will have transaction capabilities by the end of 1998. Forrester Research estimates that over $45 billion of goods and services will be sold on-line by 2000; many multiples of this will be sold through traditional channels supported by Web-based sales and marketing efforts.
</UL><P><UL><LI><B>
High cost of establishing an on-line presence. </B> Transaction-enabled Web sites are extremely expensive; the average cost of a transaction-enabled site will exceed $4 million by 1997.  Content and service constitute much of this cost, while software accounts for approximately $1 million.  Ongoing maintenance costs after establishment of the site will likely exceed $1 million annually.  Businesses, before embarking on building their sites, tend to underestimate these costs by a factor of 4x-5x.
</UL><P><UL><LI><B>
Packaged application software approach.</B> CONNECT's OneServer product is the leading packaged application software for Internet-based interactive commerce.  The Company's strategy is to reduce the cost and time-to-market for companies wishing to implement an Internet sales channel by supplying a comprehensive, off-the-shelf solution that can be implemented across a broad range of industries.  In addition, the Company is developing specific applications of its OneServer product, targeted at vertical market segments.  The first such product is OrderStream, targeted at the business-to-business market for non-production goods (IT products, office supplies, etc.).
</UL><P><UL><LI><B>
Leading client base.</B> CONNECT has licensed its OneServer application to nine customers, including Ameritech, Fruit of the Loom, Time Warner Cable and PhotoDisc.  Initial licensees of OrderStream are ENTEX and Compaq.  Three OneServer licensees are currently operating the application commercially; PhotoDisc, Fruit of the Loom, and World Merchandise Exchange.  Compaq has launched its OrderStream application, while the ENTEX OrderStream application is expected to be launched in October 1996.
</UL><P><UL><LI><B>
Partnerships for sales, marketing, technology, and implementation.</B> CONNECT has established relationships with several industry leaders to broaden acceptance of its product and to implement solutions quickly.  Marketing and implementation partners include CKS Group, Cambridge Technology Partners, Computer Sciences Corporation, BBN, Logica, and Compuware.  Technology partners included Oracle, Sun, RSA Data Security, and Sterling Commerce.

<!-- ** Suggestion: If you ever need preformatted text use the PRE and /PRE tags. ** -->
<P>
The water for the City of Mesa is developed from three general sources:  surface water from the Salt/Verde Rivers, the Colorado River, and groundwater from deep wells.</p>

<p>The system is divided into two major areas called the City Zone, which is all of the area west of the Salt River Project Eastern Canal, and the Eastern Zone which is all of the area east of the SRP Eastern Canal.</p>

<p>The City Zone is supplied by surface water from a combination of Salt River and Verde River water that is pumped from the SRP Southern Canal and treated at the Val Vista Water Treatment Plant.  This Plant now treats approximately 140 million gallons per day (mgd) of which the City of Mesa receives 50 mgd, and the City of Phoenix receives 90 mgd.</p>

<p>The Eastern Zone is supplied by surface water from the Colorado River.  This water is brought to the Mesa Water Treatment Plant throughout the Central Arizona Project Canal.  This Plant can treat approximately 24 mgd and the average water produced is now 17 mgd.</p>

<p>During periods of high demand or when maintenance is performed on the SRP or CAP canals, water from a system of deep wells is utilized.  The well system consists of thirty-three deep wells (800-1,000 feet in depth) at various locations within the City of Mesa service area.  These wells extract the naturally stored and purified water which is then chlorinated as it enters the water mains to assure it remains free of bacteria.</p>

<p>There are certain times of the year that river conditions upstream beyond our control may cause the water to have a musty odor and/or taste. This water is chlorinated during the treatment process and has a controlled chlorine residual as it leaves the Plant.  The City of Mesa water is safe and potable at all times.</p>

<p>The chlorine residual at the customer's tap will vary based upon the seasons and the source of the water.  Typically the chlorine residual ranges from .2 milligrams per litre (mg/l) to 1.0 mg/l.</p>

<p>Routine sampling based on Federal and State Regulations is performed on a regular basis.  Bacteriological samples are collected daily throughout the City, along with chlorine residuals.  Trihalomethane levels are tested quarterly.  Annual sampling is conducted for volatile organic compounds and inorganic compounds.  The levels of volatile organic compounds are below the detection limit of the testing equipment.  The inorganic analysis on the following page reflects the surface water serving each zone.</p>

<P><BR>
Cotelligent Group, Inc. is a leading supplier of information technology staffing and system integration services.  The Company was recently formed to capitalize on the significant market opportunities created by the exploding demand for skilled software programmers and project management talent. In our opinion, Cotelligent Group stock is undervalued compared to a broad list of comparable companies. The average P/E multiple on 1996 EPS for its peers is 30.7, which is 78% higher than Cotelligent Group's P/E multiple.  In addition, the Company sells at a P/E to growth-rate ratio of 0.57 as compared to the group average of 1.3.  We do not think this valuation gap can be justified on fundamental reasons.  We think Cotelligent Group stock merits a P/E multiple similar to that of its peers.  Our 12-month target stock price of $19 is based on a conservative P/E multiple (a 23% discount to the group multiple) of 23.5 times our CY97 EPS of $0.82. We rate the stock a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B>.<P><BR>

<B><I>Overview</I></B>
<P><BR>
<UL><LI>
Cotelligent is a leading supplier of information technology staffing and system integration services.  The Company was recently formed to capitalize on the significant market opportunities created by the exploding demand for skilled software programmers and project management talent.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Cotelligent provides valuable software staffing and consulting services Cotelligent consummated agreements to acquire four established businesses with its initial public offering, February 14, 1996. These companies provide staffing and computer consulting services primarily in the four major markets of Boston, New York/New Jersey, San Francisco/Silicon Valley, and Seattle.  Cotelligent personnel are highly skilled at finding the appropriate software programming personnel from a database of over 40,000 technical consultants to meet clients' specific, temporary requirements.  In addition, the Company offers consulting services to manage and deliver a complete software project.  Cotelligent targets its services to major technology corporations, telecommunications, financial services, and other organizations.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Large market potential with solid growth The overall market for system integration services is estimated at $30-40 billion annually and is growing at 12-13%.  The market for information technology staffing services is estimated at $8.9 billion (1995) and is expected to grow at a 20-25% rate.  
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Key factors driving growth in these industries include the following:
	1) Dramatic growth in the number of software technologies and 		   software packages;
	2) Increased pace of business and technological change;
	3) Upsurge in software's strategic importance;
	4) Ongoing downsizing of major business organizations; and
	5) Broad acceptance of outsourcing to achieve technological goals

</UL><BR><UL><LI>Cotelligent is well positioned to capitalize on market trends The companies that form Cotelligent are all well established in their local markets with continuous business operation for 11-plus years.  Each company is run by the founding entrepreneurs.  As with others in the staffing industry, most of Cotelligent's business activity is based on local relationships, which provide a solid base for future expansion.  By joining into the larger entity, Cotelligent, these local companies will benefit from the trend toward using fewer local firms by major corporations.  Cotelligent will also be able to leverage local relationships into nationwide business activities with major clients.

</UL><BR><UL><LI>Industry consolidation is positive for Cotelligent The information technology staffing industry has started to consolidate as some of the larger temporary staffing companies have acquired local service firms.  We expect this process to pick up speed over the next several years, as buyers begin to gain some competitive advantage on national accounts.  Cotelligent is ideally positioned to benefit from this trend, offering local company owners a unique proposition of ongoing management of their business along with equity participation in Cotelligent.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Counsel Corporation is a Toronto-based financial management company with holdings in public and private United States-based health care companies.  Its affiliates include American HomePatient, Capstone Pharmacy Services, and Stadtlander's Pharmacy.  We think there is an opportunity for investors to profit both from arbitrage on Counsel's public companies and from the growth in the underlying businesses.  We initiate coverage of Counsel Corporation with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> rating and a price target of US$13.00 based on Counsel's net asset value.


<P>
<B><I> Summary</B></I><P>
<UL><LI><B>Counsel is a way to play some great health care service companies.</B>  The Company owns 26% of American HomePatient and 26% of Capstone Pharmacy Services, both of which are growing companies in the home health and institutional pharmacy markets, respectively.  The two companies are both publicly traded.  In addition, Counsel owns 65% of Stadtlander's Pharmacy, an otherwise privately-held specialty pharmacy company that handles organ transplant and AIDS patients, and 50% of U.S. Laboratory Corporation, which does clinical lab work for nursing homes.  By buying Counsel, investors can get a package of great public companies as well as some interesting private companies that can't be owned otherwise.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Arbitrage valuation sets a floor.</B>  Since two of Counsel's largest investments are publicly traded, there is an easy floor on the value of the stock.  As virtually all the Company's earnings are incurred in U.S. dollars, there is no foreign exchange risk to the valuation.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Counsel has demonstrated the ability to add value to health care services businesses.</B>  Counsel is hardly a passive investor.  The Company's financial and operational expertise accelerated American HomePatient's growth and orchestrated Capstone Pharmacy's turn around.  It is working to grow and to improve its private businesses, too, so that investors can look forward to owning companies slated to grow faster than their industries.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Management has extensive financial and operational experience.</B>  Allan Silber, Chairman and CEO, founded Counsel Corporation in 1979.  Over the years, the Company has owned and operated financial services, real estate management, and health care services businesses.  Morris Perlis, the President, ran American Express Canada for several years, then did consulting for Bloomingdale's and Counsel Corporation before joining Counsel full-time.  These experiences mean that management knows how to deal with the issues that arise as companies go through explosive growth periods.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Portfolio approach leads to risk diversification.</B>  With several health care companies, Counsel is able to diversify the risk that is inherent to investing in any one company.  In this respect, the Company can be viewed almost as a closed-end mutual fund, investing in growing health care service companies.
</UL>
<P><BR>
<B><I>Risks</I></B>
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Key employee risk:</B>  Counsel has a lean organization.  In many respects, it is a partnership between Allan Silber and Morris Perlis;  the two work closely with the affiliated companies on financial and operational issues.  Over time, we expect Counsel to add more employees with additional expertise, which will reduce this risk.  In addition, most of its companies have strong management teams that are beyond the start-up and turn around phase and thus could prosper as independent entities. 
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Financing:</B>  Counsel's strategy is to expand in the heath care services market.  Buying and expanding new businesses require new sources of cash, meaning that the Company will be looking to debt and equity markets on a continual basis.  This creates balance sheet risk and the possibility of shareholder dilution unless the money is put to work in good investments (which Counsel has been able to do quite nicely to date). 

</UL><UL><LI><B>Turn around:</B>  Some of Counsel's investments will be in turn around companies, which may not work out as well as planned.  In fact, Counsel itself went through a dramatic turn around in the early 1990's (so management knows what is required to make one succeed).  However, as every portfolio manager knows, a few winners can more than offset the problems.  We think that Counsel's diversified approach will help it reap the rewards of companies that perform well with only limited exposure from those that do not perform as expected.
</UL>

<P></P>
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<P>
While Coventry's EPS and operating margins in 1996 may look no better than 1995's figures, the year should have an entirely different feel to it. Rather than a fast start and an ignominious finish, we anticipate a steady improvement in the tone of business as 1996 progresses. Restoration of enrollment growth, medical cost discipline, and a more clearly defined position in Pittsburgh would greatly enhance our confidence level in 1997 estimates. Pending those changes, we continue to rate the shares <B>NEUTRAL (3).</B>
<P>
<B><I>Commercial Enrollment Is a Mixed Bag</I></B>
<P>
In the commercial segment, overall membership growth on a same-store basis is averaging 7.5% in the early months of 1996. This represents a modest improvement from the 5.5-7.0% growth trend that prevailed throughout 1995. Central Pennsylvania, which was up 20%, and Richmond, up 15%, continue to be the Company's strongest commercial markets, from both an enrollment and margin perspective. Membership gains in St. Louis are only 5%, fairly low but in line with budgeted levels.
<P>
Aside from 15,800 lives purchased from Aetna, Coventry's Pittsburgh area enrollment is flat. While the purchase price for the Aetna enrollees was fairly steep at $32 million, Coventry has strong non-compete protection, and the 19% minority interest held by physicians should help improve the Company's provider network. Encouragingly, numerous sources indicate that the pricing pressure emanating from Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania, the primary catalyst in Coventry's earnings shortfall last year, has begun to ease.
<P>
<B><I>Hospital Alliances Should Benefit Coventry in Western Pennsylvania</I></B>
<P>
The level of provider consolidation in Pittsburgh -- an overbedded market of roughly 50 (all nonprofit) hospitals -- is intense. Leading this charge is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), flagship of the Tri-State Health System. While Tri-State was originally conceived as a confederation of independently owned facilities, in recent months it has veered toward financial consolidation. UPMC has negotiated the acquisition of four facilities (South Side, St. Margaret, and Aliquippa hospitals, plus a large outpatient surgery center in Monroeville) and an affiliation with McKeesport Hospital. UPMC has been reported to be in acquisition talks with at least seven other hospitals.
<P>
A rival hospital alliance, the Southwest Integrated Delivery Network (SIDN), has not been idle. Two of its charter members are also pursuing acquisitions/mergers: St. Clair Hospital with Tri-State-affiliated South Hills and Sewickely Valley with Medical Center of Beaver Valley. Both Tri-State and SIDN have begun to adopt a "you're either with us or against us" mentality. Facilities that once had hoped to remain independent, e.g., Pittsburgh Children's Hospital, face intense pressure to choose sides. A potential third network, organized by Columbia/HCA or others, remains a possibility.
<P>
Managed care -- not just Coventry, but also U.S. Healthcare and the local Blue Cross plan  -- is driving this process. Hospital administrators realize that a significant reduction in acute care capacity is both inevitable and fast approaching. To ensure survival, they seek to avoid being isolated by the two rival networks. The opportunity for Coventry in this process is to become increasingly identified with the SIDN network. Early on, the Blue Cross plan aligned itself with UPMC and the Tri-State network. In February 1996, Coventry and SIDN formalized their strategic alliance with a risk- and profit-sharing agreement covering Coventry's just-launched Medicare HMO.
<P>

As the chasm between Tri-State and SIDN widens, we expect a similar cleavage to develop in market share between aligned health plans. The rival hospital networks are roughly equal in size today. If that relationship holds true over time, Coventry (with a 10% share of total covered lives in the market) has much to gain relative to Blue Cross, which begins the process with a market share approaching 70%.
<P>
<B><I>Robust Medicaid Enrollment Gains in Missouri</I></B>
<P>
Almost half of Coventry's projected year-over-year enrollment growth reflects the Company's success in Missouri's mandated Medicaid HMO program. The Company captured 32% of eligible lives in the St. Louis area, or 49,000 new members, as one of seven participants in the program. The state is nearing completion of the second phase rollout in central Missouri, which has 40,000 eligibles. We think Coventry has captured close to 50% of the available lives in this region, which will be included with the Company's enrollment results in Q2:96. Later this year, the state will begin final-phase enrollment of 125,000 eligibles in the Kansas City region. Coventry will compete aggressively in this region as well, although the Company will not be working from an established base of commercial business.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>As organizations migrate their communications traffic from private to public networks, comprehensive information security solutions become essential. Secure communications infrastructures are the key to widespread adoption of on-line applications such as remote computing and electronic commerce. Cylink has established itself as a leading vendor of public key encryption technology, and has recently announced the industry's first family of security products that offer a complete, enterprisewide solution. In addition, the Company's wireless communications products are ideally suited to address demand for telecommunications infrastructure in developing countries. We believe Cylink is well-positioned to grow earnings in excess of 50% over the next several years, and maintain its role as a dominant player in the information security market and a leading vendor of unlicensed wireless communications equipment.
<P>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<BR><P>
Desktop Data is the leading independent provider of customized, real-time news and information delivered over corporate LANs.  The Company recently introduced NewsEDGE/WEB, an extension to Desktop Data's market-leading NewsEDGE service.  NewsEDGE/WEB, which will be available in Q3:96, allows thousands of end users connected to their enterprise intranet to monitor, search for and retrieve specific, personalized, and salient information, which is delivered directly to their desktops.  In addition, the Company recently announced its financial results for Q1:96, which exceeded our estimates.  We expect the Company to continue to generate significant growth in revenue, earnings, and operating cash flow over the next two years, and we rate the stock a <B>BUY (2)</B> with a price target of $47.
<BR><P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The Emergence of the Intranet.</B>
Intranets can be loosely defined as the use of Internet technologies behind the protection of a corporate "firewall;" the firewall lets users out to the resources of the Internet but denies access to unauthorized visitors.  According to a recent study, 16% of large U.S. companies had installed an intranet; another 50% were considering installation. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>NewsEDGE/WEB.</B> NewsEDGE/WEB, an extension of Desktop Data's market-leading NewsEDGE service, allows personalized news profiling and searching for thousands of end users connected to their enterprise intranet.  With NewsEDGE/WEB, users can view news via industry-standard browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.  We believe NewsEDGE/WEB is the first major content-enabled intranet application.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Leverages the investments corporations have made in intranet technology.</B> Companies across all industries are rapidly deploying intranet technologies to provide their employees with faster, more efficient desktop access to corporate and external data.  For example, Internet browsers are fast becoming standard desktop applications distributed throughout an enterprise.  The high value-added content provided by Desktop Data is a perfect application for MIS directors seeking information to deliver over the corporate intranets they have built.
<BR><BR>
By leveraging the enterprisewide distribution of "universal client" browser technology, Desktop Data's software needs only to be installed on the Web server (the browser is the end-user client), allowing for significantly easier NewsEDGE distribution enterprisewide.  Also, by taking advantage of the stateless nature of Web technology, a single NewsEDGE/WEB server can support over 2,000 end users, while NewsEDGE customers are generally limited to 250 end users per server, although many customers have more than one server.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Intranet delivery allows for huge scale economies for corporate customers; "bagel-chip" pricing Desktop's pricing scheme allows for significant economies of scale for higher user numbers.</B>  For example, increasing the number of users within an organization from 200 to 2,000 drops the cost-per-user-per-day to $0.27 from $0.89, yet results in a threefold aggregate revenue increase to Desktop.</UL>

<UL><LI>
<B>Extensions to NewsEDGE/WEB complete the information circle. </B> NewsEDGE/WEB is the first in a progression of NewsEDGE capabili-ties designed to take advantage of the Internet and corporate in-tranets.  The Company is also planning to introduce LinkEDGE/WEB, an extension of the Company's LinkEDGE technology announced in December 1995, which will allow end users to hypertext link from URLs in a news story to the referenced site on the World Wide Web (WWW). NewsEDGE Agent will extend the NewsEDGE server's monitoring and filtering capabilities to include Internet content.  Thus, through these extensions Desktop Data will allow access to the Web as well as monitoring information from it.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<BR><P>
Digi International is a remote networking company with proven engineering expertise and strong sales channels. It is the leader in the multiuser business, and a Company that has consistently produced good financial results. We think that Digi can leverage its strengths and become an important player in the remote access and LAN connect/switching markets. The Company has recently embarked on an aggressive strategy to exploit niche segments in these markets; especially those ignored by larger competitors such as small- and medium-sized corporations. Today, Digi International is poised for strong revenue and earnings growth. 
<P>
We think that the Company's stock warrants a multiple closer to its growth rate and believe the stock could trade at around 17 times our CY:97 EPS estimate of $2.25. This suggests a 12-month price target of $38. Therefore, we are initiating coverage with a <B>BUY(2)</B> rating.

<BR><P>

<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Digi International is a nimble networking company poised for strong growth in the remote access and LAN connect/switching markets.</B> Digi, with its core engineering expertise and sales channel strengths, has consistently produced good financial results over the years to become the leader in the multiuser business. But when the Company identified a slowing down in this business, it quickly recognized that its core skills could be applied to the rapidly expanding remote access and LAN connect/switching markets. The Company embarked on an aggressive strategy to exploit niche segments in these markets, especially those ignored by larger competitors, and today is poised for strong revenue and earnings growth. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company is a key vendor in important markets serving small- and medium-sized businesses.</B> Market research indicates that there are more companies being set up in these categories, and unlike in the past, many of them view today's affordable information technologies, including networking, as powerful competitive weapons. We think that Digi International, with its innovative and low-cost networking products and its distribution channels, will become an important vendor serving small- and medium-sized companies. Most of these companies purchase their networking equipment from the distribution channels where Digi has long established a firm foothold. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Focused R&D spending should result in a stream of innovative products and lead to more OEM opportunities.</B> The Company's engineering skills, especially its expertise in ISDN, serial communications, operating systems, and driver interfaces, have helped it develop key alliances with Microsoft and Novell, as well as key OEM customers like IBM, AT&T, Tektronix, and DEC. We expect these R&D efforts to result in a stream of new products that will make the Company an invaluable strategic partner.</UL>

<P>
The market for Imaging, Workflow, Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD), and Document Management software -"The Dynamic Document" market - is expected to grow from $833 million in 1995 to $2.2 billion in 1998, a compound annual growth rate of 38%.  We believe the market is now at an inflection point and primed for fast growth, driven by the availability of lower-cost, open platform-based applications and increased VAR integration and customization expertise.  Software companies that can bring these technologies together into an integrated suite of products (by acquisition or partnerships) and position these products in the high growth Windows NT market, should generate substantial investment returns through 1997.

<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Convergence</STRONG></DL>
The separate technologies of Imaging, Workflow, Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD), and Document Management are finding synergy in today's market place (see Exhibit 1).  The convergence of these technologies will provide a faster, less costly solution to address the  customer's need to access and process many types of electronic information across an enterprise.  Currently, companies are successfully offering products that address only one, two, or at most, three of these areas.  In order to flourish in this market in the future, however, they
 will need to provide tighter integration of all four product areas and have the ability to sell these products as a product suite.  A vendor could sell one product independent of the others, but if the customer needs the other products later there should be few, if any, product integration costs.
<P>
Customers in the Dynamic Document market want easy migration paths to the related technologies that will generate a significant return on investment.  For example, one company may start out with a production imaging system and later decide it needs document management to unleash this island of information across an organization.  Another company may start with imaging and later learn the benefits of adding workflow software to route documents automatically.  Most customers will not want to pay an excessive amount to integrate two, three, or four products.  
<P>
This is the Microsoft Office product marketing concept applied to the Dynamic Document area.  Let's say a customer needs a spreadsheet program and is deciding between Microsoft's Excel and Quattro Pro.  The customer, knowing that a word processing or presentation program will eventually also be needed, would prefer one that will work with the spreadsheet program.  Quattro Pro may be the better individual spreadsheet product, but Excel works better with everything else the customer will need; therefore, Microsoft gets the order.  
<P>
The Dynamic Document purchasing decision may be influenced two ways:  (i) the customer will make an initial product purchase (e.g., imaging), get familiar with it and realize a return on investment, then purchase other products (e.g., workflow), or (ii) the customer may buy the total suite of products (even though it only needs imaging today) for a cost that is less than the sum of purchasing each product individually.  The product suite concept is the same for imaging, workflow, COLD, and document management software as for desktop office software, but due to its complexity and mission critical nature the price point is much higher.
<P><BR>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Total Market Size</STRONG></DL>
<P>

The total market size for Dynamic Document software was $658 million worldwide in 1994; it grew to $833 million in 1995, and is expected to grow to $2.2 billion by 1998, a compound annual growth rate of 38% (see Exhibit 3).  We will break out the market size of the four individual areas of Imaging software, Workflow software, COLD software, and Document Management software in other sections of this report.
<P><BR>
<DL><DT><STRONG>High-growth Area Shifts to NT</STRONG></DL>
<P>
The flexibility, computing power, and cost-effectiveness of distributed processing in an open systems environment have encouraged numerous large organizations to move many mission-critical computer applications to client/server systems from mainframes. In particular, the widespread adoption of client/server computing systems has significantly reduced the investment required to install, implement, and operate mission-critical imaging, workflow, COLD, and document management software applications. 
<P>
Most client/server production imaging systems are currently based on UNIX operating systems. However, a 1996 IDC study predicts that while shipments of UNIX servers for all software applications will grow from 462,000 in 1994 to 766,000 in 1998, a 13% annual growth rate, shipments of Windows NT servers will grow from 115,000 in 1994 to 1,170,000 in 1998, a 79% annual growth rate, challenging UNIX as the leading server software (see Exhibit 4). 
<P>
The Windows NT operating system is expected to experience significant growth due to the large installed base of Windows NT-ready personal computers, its user friendliness and its relatively low user cost compared to the cost of UNIX systems.  In the past, UNIX was the only operating system that delivered the power necessary to perform complex production imaging.  With the emergence of the Windows NT operating system, an alternative technological infrastructure to 

<P>
UNIX is now in place.  Optika and Viewstar have developed Windows NT-based products internally while Wang and FileNet have acquired companies with this technology.
<P>
Wang acquired Sigma for its very robust production-oriented imaging and workflow software that runs on Windows NT.  Wang also acquired a leading hierarchical storage management (HSM) company called Avail, as well as Vantage Technologies, a document management software company.  FileNet acquired Watermark for low-end desktop imaging software, Saros for its document management software products, and Greenbar for its COLD software products.  As expected, all these companies have relationships with Microsoft.

<I><B>Investment Thesis</B></I>
<BR><P>
Elcom International is a leader in the development, licensing, and operation of interactive electronic commerce systems.  We expect the Company to generate revenue and EPS growth of 55% and 121% respectively during 1997.  Based on this estimated EPS growth in 1997, we are initiating coverage with a <B>BUY (2)</B> recommendation and a price target of $14 1/4.<BR><P>
<I><B>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Leading player in electronic commerce systems.</B> Elcom's proprietary software technology enables a company, either its Catalink subsidiary or a licensee, to create interactive electronic catalog and ordering systems and thereby market products and services through PC-based electronic commerce systems.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Elcom's wholly owned subsidiary, Catalink, was the first to commercially apply the PECOS technology (Personal Electronic Catalog and Ordering System). </B>  Catalink uses the PECOS technology to electronically market and sell PC-related products. </UL>

<UL><LI><B>Motivated, experienced management team.</B>
Bob Crowell, Elcom's founder, chairman, and CEO has previously founded and managed three companies:  NEECO a publicly-held PC products reseller; Microamerica Distributing, a PC products distributor later known as Merisel; and Professional Software, a word processing and database software company.  Crowell ran each of these companies until their initial public offering or sale.  Six of Elcom's senior executives have been employed with Mr. Crowell for more than 10 years by one or more of these companies.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>Catalink has achieved rapid growth.</B> Catalink commenced operations in December 1993 and should achieve $270.2 million in revenue for 1995.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>Growth is being driven by</B> i) experienced management, ii) PECOS system technology, iii) acquisitions, and iv) a $70 billion market opportunity. </UL>

<UL><LI><B>Acquisitions.</B> Elcom has completed three acquisitions of PC product remarketers in the last year and three months:  CDCI in October 1994, Computerware in February 1995, and Lantec in June 1995.  The Company expects to acquire additional companies to expand market share and/or complement its PECOS technology. </UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Internal Growth.</B> For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, Catalink Direct (excluding acquisitions of Computerware and Lantec) had sales of $76.6 million vs. $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1994, representing growth of 359%.  Virtually all of this revenue is being generated through the use of the PECOS systems. </UL>

<UL><LI><B>Revenue to grow rapidly.</B> Reported revenue for the first nine months of 1995 was $174.2 million, and on a pro forma basis was $233.1 million.  We project that revenue for Q4:95 will be $96.0 million, representing an annual run rate of $384 million.  For 1996, we estimate revenue at $567 million and $880 million for 1997. </UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Profitability to be achieved in Q4:95 and EPS to grow rapidly in 1996 and 1997.</B> We estimate that Elcom will achieve profitability in Q4:95, attain EPS of $0.28 in 1996, and $0.62 in 1997. </UL>

<UL><LI><B>Valuation.</B> Based on a multiple of 23x our 1997 EPS estimate of $0.62, we are initiating coverage with a <B>BUY (2)</B> rating and a price target of $14 1/4.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P> Electronic Information Management market (EIM) is a $2.2 billion market which is expected to grow to $8.6 billion by 1998 as companies worldwide reengineer outdated business processes with powerful, technology based solutions.  This explosive growth will lead to exciting investment opportunities in companies that provide effective total EIM system solutions, and companies that provide superior key component technology solutions.  We're inaugurating coverage of this emerging indus-try with this report.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points and Conclusions</I></B>
<UL><LI>
The factors coming together to promote explosive growth in the EIM market include; (i)  a willingness on the part of companies to examine existing business processes and use technology to change the way things are done, (ii) vendors who used to supply proprietary systems now offering open system solutions, and (iii) the widespread adoption of client/server computing which resulted in declining costs per seat for EIM solutions.
</UL><UL><LI>
Currently the largest market segment of EIM, providing investors with exciting investment opportunities, is Document Image Processing, a $2.1 billion market in 1993 expected to grow to a $7.5 billion market by 1998.
</UL><UL><LI>
Two ways for companies to service the rapidly growing DIP market are: (i) as a systems solution provider focusing on production imaging applications  (ii)  as a key technology component devel-oper.
</UL><UL><LI>
A systems solution vendor must provide (i)  open systems and integration capability, (ii)  specific application development expertise, preferably with an installed base to act as references, and (iii) maintenance and support services
</UL><UL><LI>
A key technology component supplier can address the market by providing products in one of  four categories including; (i) information input, (ii) information storage, (iii) information display, and (iv) software application tools.
</UL><UL><LI>
Either approach requires well developed distribution channels to leverage the growth in the market.  A system solution vendor must have both a strong direct sales organization as well as partnerships with Systems Integrators and VARs.  A component supplier must establish relationships with solution vendors, system integrators and VARs who have account control.
</UL><UL><LI>
Another explosive market segment of EIM is Document Management Software, currently dominated by privately held companies.  This was a $94 million market in 1993 and is expected to grow to over $1 billion by 1998.</UL>

<!-- BEGIN REPORTS HERE --------------------------------------- -->

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>

<P><BR>
EndoSonics Corp. recently emerged as the technology leader in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), one of the fastest-growing segments of the interventional cardiology market.  We think the IVUS market will sustain its tremendous growth, particularly once reimbursement for IVUS kicks in for the first time in the U.S. early next year. EndoSonics itself is facing several milestones, including the achievement of profitability in the first quarter of 1997.  Over time, the company will create additional value as it leverages its proprietary all-electronic imaging technology by expanding beyond the cardiovascular system into other parts of the body where more effective diagnosis is possible using catheter-based imaging devices. We reiterate our <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> rating on the stock with a 12-month price target of $21.

<P><BR>

<B><I>The Company</B></I><BR>
<P><BR>
With the recent carve-out of CardioVascular Dynamics, Inc. in an initial public offering, EndoSonics is now a pure play in the intravascular ultrasound market. The carve-out of CVD will allow EndoSonics to focus more resources in the fast-growing IVUS field.  It will also make it possible for EndoSonics to accelerate efforts to expand its proprietary all-electronic ultrasound imaging technology for applications in several areas of the body outside the cardiovascular system.  EndoSonics has formed a subsidiary, MicroSound, to undertake these research and development efforts.
<P>
We have revised our models for EndoSonics to reflect the split-off of the CVD specialty catheter business.  These changes are summarized in Exhibit 1.  Our new model represents only the expected contribution from the company's core IVUS business.  We do not anticipate any contribution to sales or earnings from the company's recently formed MicroSound subsidiary until after 1998.  We are projecting that EndoSonics' IVUS product sales will grow at a compound rate of 56% through 1998.  We are estimating that the company will reach profitability in the first quarter of 1997.

<P>

EndoSonics has approximately $40 million, or roughly $2.95 per share, in cash.  The company owns 4,040,000 CVD shares, or 46% of the shares outstanding, which at CVD's current stock price represents an asset of $53.5 million, or roughly $3.98 per EndoSonics share. Among the milestones that we think will drive the stock over the next year will be the beginning of U.S. reimbursement for IVUS, positive new clinical data on the importance of IVUS in a variety of interventional cardiology procedures, positive "classification" statements on IVUS from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, and the company's own transition to profitability. See Exhibit 2.
<P>
<B></I>Dramatic Growth Ahead for IVUS</I></B>

Even in the absence of reimbursement, the IVUS market has been undergoing dramatic growth. This growth has been triggered by the recognition that IVUS technology improves the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease, and that IVUS is especially critical in the deployment of stents.
<P>
IVUS, which allows the cardiologist to look directly inside the blood vessel, provides important information not available from X-ray angiography, which provides only an external "shadow-gram" of the vessel.  IVUS provides the necessary details about the precise size, location, distribution, and composition of atherosclerotic plaque, and thus helps the physician to make the most informed decision about which therapeutic devices and techniques to employ.  IVUS is also essential to determine whether a stent has been properly placed, and, in particular, whether the stent has been adequately implanted into the vessel wall to avoid complications such as the formation of blood clots.
<P>
The worldwide market for IVUS systems nearly doubled in 1994 to approximately $35 million, due largely to the use of stents.  We estimate that the IVUS market grew by more than 57% to approximately $55 million in 1995.  We think that the growing recognition of the clinical value of IVUS in all types of interventional procedures, combined with the availability of reimbursement in the U.S. for the first time, will lead to sustained growth in the market for this technology. As shown in Exhibit 3, we project that the worldwide IVUS equipment market will grow at a compound rate of 31% to at least $125 million in 1998.
<P>
<B><I> EndoSonics: IVUS Technology Leader, Market Share Gainer
</B></I><P>
We think EndoSonics is the best positioned company in the expanding market for IVUS products.  In addition to the solid underlying growth for the IVUS market in general, EndoSonics has at least three things going for it that will drive the company to further growth and market penetration over the next few years.
<P>
The first advantage is superior technology: EndoSonics, now, has the best image quality in the IVUS business.  Second, EndoSonics has the only FDA-approved combined therapeutic and IVUS catheter in the industry.  This gives EndoSonics the competitive advantage of being able to simplify interventional procedures and to cut equipment costs.  The third element of the company's future success is the strength of its distribution: Johnson & Johnson/Cordis is the company's worldwide marketing partner, except for Japan where Fukuda Denshi Co., Ltd. is the company's distributor. J&J/Cordis has put together a remarkable sales and marketing infrastructure to support EndoSonics' IVUS products, while in Japan the IVUS market is getting a boost from the recent reimbursement allowance.
<P>
EndoSonics is the smallest of the three U.S.-based manufacturers of IVUS systems. CardioVascular Imaging Systems (CVIS), a division of Boston Scientific Corp., and Hewlett-Packard's Diagnostic Imaging Division each had about a 40% share of the worldwide market at the end of 1995, while EndoSonics had approximately 20%. Exhibit 4 depicts how we expect this market to shift by 1998, when EndoSonics' clear competitive advantages should lead to significant market share gains.
<P>

<B><I> Adding Value through New Applications</B></I><P>

EndoSonics has formed a subsidiary, MicroSound, to develop its all-electronic ultrasound technology for a variety of medical applications outside the field of cardiovascular medicine.  There are a number of disease conditions in which less-invasive, earlier diagnosis is possible with the use of catheter-based imaging systems.
<P>
EndoSonics' transducer/scanhead, which is just one millimeter in diameter, is the smallest commercially available ultrasound array in the world.  This distinctive technology makes it possible to access many vessels and cavities within the body.  For example, in the field of urology, a catheter can be inserted through the urethra to image BPH, prostate cancer, or urethral strictures.  The technology might also be applicable to common bile duct explorations, gastroscopic exams, and infertility exams.
<P>
It will be several years before any products that might emerge from the MicroSound R&D effort would reach the market.  Over time, as the company makes progress with these programs, the perceived value of the company's technology will certainly be enhanced.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
We expect FileNet, a leading vendor of imaging, workflow, and docu-ment management systems, to generate 79% compound EPS growth in the next two years driven by an estimated 45% compound growth rate for high-margin software sales.  FileNet, a leader in its industry, is trading at only 21x our FY:97 estimate of $2.70.  We continue to recommend purchase of FileNet with a <B>BUY (2)</B> rating and a one-year price target of $68.
<P>
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Q1:96 results.</B> On April 18, 1996, FileNet reported Q1:96 revenue of $66.7 million versus our estimate of $68 million.  Gross margin was 64.7% versus our estimate of 63.0% and EPS of $0.25 was in line with our estimate.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Raising EPS estimates for FY:96 and FY:97.</B> We are raising our FY:96 EPS estimate from $1.85 to $2.00 and for FY:97 from $2.60 to $2.70.  We adjusted our FY:96 revenue estimate to $305.0 million from $305.7 million, while our FY:97 revenue estimate remains un-changed.  The increase in EPS in FY:96 is due to a change in the ex-pected tax rate from 30% to 25% because of the NOLs associated with the recent acquisitions of Watermark and Saros. </UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Gross margins should increase in 1996 and 1997.</B> Gross margin is expected to increase from 61% in 1995 to 66% in 1996 and to 69% in 1997 as high-margin software revenue continues to increase as a per-centage of total revenue.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>Franklin Electronic Publishers (Franklin) is metamorphosing from a distributor of consumer electronic devices (hardware) into a publisher of historic and time sensitive databases (software).  Investors have not yet perceived the positive implications from this transition, but with a forecasted acceleration in sales and earnings momentum, we believe the stock can trade at $17 per share over the next twelve months, about a 30% gain from the current price.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</I></B>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Franklin is the market leader for publishing fixed platform electronic books, with a 70% share of the domestic market.
</UL><UL>
<LI> Franklin has recently launched a flexible platform (the Digital Book System or DBS) that will transform the company from a distributor of consumer electronic devices (hardware) into a publisher of historic and time sensitive databases (software).
</UL><UL>
<LI>Despite a projected flat year in sales, EPS should increase about 10% in fiscal year (FY) 1994 (ended March 31, 1994).  Franklin is poised to experience renewed growth in revenues and accelerating growth in EPS in FY 1995 due to the introduction of new products, expansion into new international markets, and leveraging new vertical market distribution channels.
</UL><UL>
<LI>Franklin stock is currently selling at 16.6 times projected fully-taxed calendar 1994 earnings of $0.79.  We believe that as Franklin products double digit sales and EPS gains during FY 1995, investors will be attracted to the stock, and we project a valuation of 17 times our fully-taxed calendar 1995 EPS estimate of $1.00 or $17 per share.  This suggests upside of about 30% from today's price of $13.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
The consumer software industry is maturing and consolidating.  The industry's winners will be those companies with broad product lines, strong distribution relationships, and resources to aggressively promote products. GT Interactive Software is one of the best positioned publishers to compete successfully in this environment.
<P>
GTIS is currently trading at approximately 21 times our CY96 EPS estimate of $0.50, a significant discount to its growth rate and to comparable companies. We are initiating coverage with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendation and our 12-month price target is $19.
<P>
<B><I>Introduction</I></B>

<P>GT Interactive Software (GT) is a leading publisher, merchandiser and distributor of consumer software. The company recognized early the importance of distribution in the consumer software industry, and is now the primary distributor of PC software to Wal-Mart and Target, and of PC budget software to K-Mart. Based on the strength of these distribution arrangements, GT has been able to sign long-term contracts with leading developers like id Software, Zombie, Williams Entertainment, Mercer Mayer, and Stan and Jan Berenstain. This strategy - marrying content and distribution - has proven very successful for the company. In only two years, GT  has emerged as one of the leading publishers of consumer software, growing sales from $10 million in 1993 to over $200 million in 1995, an accomplishment made even more impressive considering the intense level of competition in this industry.  We estimate that in 1995 GT ranked among the top three publishers in dollar volume and units sold in the entertainment and budget software categories.<P>

<B><I>Summary</I></B>

<UL><LI><B>The consumer software industry is projected to grow at a healthy 20-25%.</B> Despite widely expressed concerns about slowing growth, we think the demand for consumer software is still strong and provides near-term opportunities for certain publishers.
</UL><UL><LI>
<B>Companies like GT Interactive Software that possess broad product lines, strong distribution relationships, and aggressive marketing will grow faster than the industry.</B>  The changing characteristics of this industry increasingly favor bigger players who have the resources to make a substantial commitment to the category. GT and a few others will be able to take share from the smaller players who will find it difficult to compete. In our opinion, the consumer software industry is similar to other, more mature, media industries - in the long run, only a handful of dominant companies and a host of small, lean ones will remain.
</UL><UL><LI>
<B>GT has powerful distribution relationships that enable it to attract leading small developers.</B> We think that GT's relationships with Wal-Mart and Target not only provide important channels for its published products, but also enable the company to attract some of the best small developers who are content-rich but distribution-poor.
</UL><UL><LI>
<B>Strength in the company's high-margin publishing business and operating efficiencies should produce increased overall margins.</B>  GT plans on releasing over 40 SKUs in 1996 versus 20 in 1995 and 3 in 1994, driving operating margins to 16.7% in 1996 from 14.6% in 1995. 
</UL><UL><LI>
<B>We think there is upside to our estimates in 1996 and 1997.</B> We have deliberately been conservative in our estimates. We have not projected any hit titles, but it is likely that there will be some. Additionally, we expect GT to reach agreements with other high-quality developers, which means additional titles not reflected in our model. Also, given the success the company has had with Wal-Mart and Target, GT could announce new mass merchant partners.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>Henry Schein, Inc. is a major distributor of equipment and supplies to dentists, dental laboratories, physicians, veterinarians, and other healthcare practitioners in the United States, Canada, and Europe.  Our expectation of 20% long-term earnings growth should be driven by increasing demand, rising prices, market share gains, geographic expansion, and operating improvements.  In addition, acquisition could accelerate this growth rate.  We are initiating coverage of Henry Schein, Inc. with a <B>BUY (2)</B> rating and a 12-month price target of $44 - an appreciation potential of almost 20% from current price levels. 
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Strong market presence.</B>  Henry Schein commands a 14% market share, making it the second largest supplier in the highly fragmented U.S. dental market.  In addition to the dental market, the Company operates in other fragmented markets, like the medical and veterinary supplies markets.  In each of these market segments, the Company has become a major player because of its superior service, low prices, and aggressive promotion.</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Penetration of  non-dental practitioners offers opportunities for growth.</B>  The Company's non-dental businesses, including medical supplies, veterinary supplies, and international dental sales, contribute more than 40% to revenue; however, market penetration for these businesses is less than the 14% attained by the Company's core dental operations.  This means that the Company can grow through market share gains in all its businesses, particularly those that are even more fragmented than the U.S. dental operations.</UL>

<LI>
<B>International markets present additional avenues for growth.</B> Henry Schein receives almost 20% of revenue from international sales of supplies and equipment to dentists in seven European countries.  The Company is beginning to offer veterinary supplies in two of these countries.  By adding more markets and by expanding the number of practitioners served in existing markets, Henry Schein can grow more than competitors focussed solely on North America or on one product line.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>As revenue grows, the Company should show operating leverage.</B>  Henry Schein has fairly thin operating margins.  In 1995, the Company's operating margin was 3.2%, up from 2.9% in 1994.  Since the Company's infrastructure is in place, there will be no major additions to expenses as the Company posts major sales increases; therefore, increasing operating margins.  We estimate that operating margins will increase to 3.7% in 1996, and to 3.8% in 1997.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>We anticipate strong EPS growth.</B>  Based on market share gains, internal expansion, and operating leverage, we are estimating 20% growth in earnings per share for both 1996 and 1997.  Acquisition activity could also lead to upside revisions in our estimates.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
			
<P>
Health Systems Design Corporation (HSDC) is the leading pure-play company in the burgeoning market for managed care software systems. We expect HSDC to grow earnings at least 40% annually over the next few years due to (i) rapid market growth in a niche with major barriers to entry, (ii) strong core products and demand for advanced client/server architectures, (iii) new sales and marketing initiatives, and (iv) the Company's distribution alliance with Shared Medical Systems (SMED).  Our one-year price target is $25 and our rating is <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B>.
<P>
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<UL><LI>
Managed Care Software is One of the Fastest-Growing HCIS Segments.  As managed care continues its dramatic expansion (see Exhibit 1), virtually all providers and payers will be subject to managed care participation arrangements, creating a large, rapidly growing market for core managed care information systems.</UL><UL><LI>
We characterize these systems as "must have" as they are required to support payer/provider contracting, eligibility and benefit tracking, referral and authorization administration, claims processing and adjudication, and the utilization analysis of healthcare services.  We think the market for managed care information systems will grow from about $461 million in 1995 to well over $3 billion by the year 2000.  This represents a 47% CAGR, which exceeds growth in all other HCIS segments (see Exhibit 2).
</UL><UL><LI>
Technology Leadership and High Barriers to Entry.  Managed care information systems must have complex capabilities which create both unique technical challenges and barriers to entry for systems developers due to their breadth of functionality, high transaction volumes, and complex tracking and reporting requirements.
 </UL><UL><LI>
HSDC differentiates itself with its products that feature advanced managed care functionality; object-oriented, client/server architecture employing a graphical user interface; and a proprietary class library of development objects.  HSDC's software and core architecture provide the only commercially available, comprehensive managed care information system using open, client/server technology that is designed to grow with managed care organizations.  HSDC's products address organizations ranging in size from start-up entities to the largest of integrated delivery systems.
</UL><UL><LI> 
 Relationship with SMED.  HSDC and Shared Medical Systems  (SMED) are working in alliance to provide a fully integrated managed care solution with the SMED product line.  SMED has about 300 direct sales reps and, based on 1995 revenues, is the largest provider of  healthcare information systems to hospitals and multi-entity healthcare enterprises  in the United States.  SMED has the worldwide, exclusive right to market HSDC's products to its installed client base of over 1,500 provider organizations.  In Q1:96, SMED sold six HSDC systems, or about two per month 3/4 a rate we expect to increase over time.
</UL><UL><LI> 
Large Number of Future Opportunities.  HSDC's excellent client reputation, managed care software expertise, technology platform, sizable reference base of over 60 clients, and large distribution opportunity with SMED provides the Company with a tremendous opportunity to (i) expand its software offerings, (ii) develop high-margin professional services, (iii) cross-sell new products and services to existing clients (especially as those client organizations grow), and (iv) develop alliances with additional third-party vendors and multi-entity group purchasing organizations.  </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>Home Health Corporation of  America, Inc. provides care for patients at home.  The Company focuses on home nursing but also markets respiratory therapy, medical equipment, and infusion therapy.  Its strategy is to be a one-stop-shop for doctors, case managers, and managed care organizations who need comprehensive home health services for their patients.  A strong regional provider, HHCA concentrates on Florida and the mid-Atlantic and is especially active in consolidating its markets.  In addition, the Company is a beneficiary of potential reforms in Medicare regulations that may enhance the profitability of Medicare nursing services.  We are looking for fully diluted earnings per share of $0.59 for the fiscal year ending June 1996 and $0.75 for the fiscal year ending June 1997.  With a long-term growth rate of 20%, we have a 12-month price target of $14 based on calendar 1996 earnings per share estimated at $0.68.  This represents potential price appreciation of 80%.  We rate the stock as a <B>STRONG BUY (1).</B>
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Home Health Corporation is consolidating its markets. </B> It has 12 offices in the mid-Atlantic region (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland) and another eight in Florida.  The Company has made six acquisitions since July 1992, adding depth to its covered geography as well as expanding its territory and increasing the kinds of services offered.  We expect the Company to continue to grow through regional consolidation.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>HHCA is nursing-oriented.</B> Unlike many of its competitors, HHCA offers nursing as well as other home health equipment and services.  About 70% of the Company's total revenue comes from nursing and related services.  By handling nursing, HHCA can take on complex patient cases that general equipment companies cannot, thus making it a true one-stop-shop.  This means that the Company has a role in dealing with managed care even under a large national or regional contractor.  By contrast,  Apria and American HomePatient have virtually no nursing services while Pediatric Services is about 40% nursing - but only for pediatric patients.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Managed care understands the value of nursing.</B>  To get patients out of the hospital sooner,  patients and families need not only proper equipment but also home care support.  Nursing allows for sick patients to be discharged sooner and for terminally ill patients to rest in the comfort of their own homes (hospice care).  Managed care organizations rely on HHCA to care for patients at a lower cost than in the hospital.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>State legislators understand the value of nursing.</B>  In two states in HHCA's regions - Maryland and New Jersey - the state law now requires managed care organizations to pay for 48 hours of hospital stay after a routine childbirth.  An exception is made if nursing visits are provided.  This creates demand from managed care organizations for HHCA's nursing services.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company has a strong operating management. </B> Home Health Corporation's senior managers all have worked in the home health business for years.  The CEO, Bruce Feldman, started the predecessor to the Company in 1977.  The COO, Fred Nicholas, joined HHCA in 1992 after he sold the company he ran, Unity Health Care, to another company.  Before running Unity, he was vice president of operations for Staff Builders, a publicly traded home-nursing company.  The CFO, Jim Swiniuch, joined HHCA in 1991 after working as an outside auditor for several insurance companies, including Independence Blue Cross where he audited home health care companies as a Medicare intermediary.  Clearly, HHCA's management understands home health.  They bring a demonstrated track record of skilled operations.</UL>


<UL>
<LI><B>Medicare reform could actually help HHCA.</B>  Under current law, Medicare nursing agencies cannot make a profit but instead are reimbursed for all costs of business, including owners' salaries, up to a maximum cost cap.  Most companies in the business therefore have no incentive to keep costs down.  HHCA, on the other hand, decided that profits were good and kept its cost low so as to make a profit in non-Medicare nursing and in related services like durable medical equipment, respiratory therapy, and intravenous drugs.  Current proposals in Congress could set up a prospective payment system for Medicare nursing, which would pay companies a fee for service that was lower than the current cap but not provide reimbursement for costs.  This would allow cost-conscious companies like HHCA to make a profit while gaining market share from competitors with a high-cost base.  This is not in our models, but it is a potential benefit to the Company in the future.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P><BR> 
IDX Systems Corp. is a leading provider of healthcare information systems (HCIS) to the large physician group practice and emerging integrated delivery network (IDN) segment of the HCIS market.

Since its IPO in November 1995, IDX has consistently exceeded our expectations. The Company has grown its IDN market share, enhanced its dominant position in the large group market segment, expanded its service and support organization, and successfully advanced its product pipeline.  As a result, IDX has posted better than expected financial results for its first three quarters as a public company and increased its backlog 20% year-over-year.  Consequently, we are raising our 1997 EPS estimates by $0.06 in 1997 - from $0.82 to $0.88 - reflecting the Company's strong business momentum and high level of visibility on our financial estimates.

<P><BR>
<B><I> PPMIS is the "Sweet Spot" of the Industry </I></B>
<P>
The physician practice management information systems (PPMIS) segment is one of the fastest-growing areas of the healthcare information systems (HCIS) market, expanding from about $1 billion in 1995 (excluding services) to over $4.0 billion by the year 2000.  This represents a 28% annual growth rate over the next five years 3/4 approximately twice the rate of growth in the HCIS market as a whole. Mirroring the ongoing consolidation among providers in the healthcare industry, the high-end of the PPMIS market is the fastest-growing sub-segment.
<P>
Managed care is the primary economic force behind the resurgent spending in the PPMIS market segment. In response to growing pressure from large and powerful employer groups, healthcare payers are increasingly shifting financial risk to providers, as well as demanding price concessions and proof of quality. Declining physician compensation and growing competition is driving the consolidation of physician groups seeking to gain bargaining power, generate economies of scale, and manage financial risk. In addition, managed care is steering healthcare dollars towards cost-effective, integrated care networks.
<P>
In response to these factors, physicians are consolidating horizontally into larger groups and vertically into IDNs, which can combine inpatient, ambulatory, and even insurance components into one geographically-dispersed enterprise. In the 1996 HIMSS survey, 80% of healthcare executive respondents indicated that their organization either is, or will soon become, part of an IDN. These trends are having profound effects on healthcare IT spending in several ways: 
<P>
<I><B>Healthcare IT budgets are expanding</B></I><P>
<UL><LI>
In addition, the current robust growth in healthcare IT spending clearly will last for a number of years.  This view is supported by the 1996 HIMSS survey in which 76% of healthcare administrators expect their IT budgets to increase at least 20% annually over the next two years.</UL>
<P>
<I><B>System sales are getting larger and more complicated.  </B></I><P>
<UL><LI>Consolidation is increasing the size of the average provider organization, and providers are buying more multi-modular product suites.  These trends are resulting in an increase in average selling price (ASP) for new client sales.  For example, in IDX's Enterprise Division, which specializes in sales to large groups and IDNs, ASPs have grown from $1.2 million to $1.8 million in the last three quarters.<P>
</UL><UL><LI>
 A new breed of enterprise-wide and clinical products are hitting the market that are designed to integrate administrative processes and manage patient care throughout an IDN. For example, enterprise-wide systems include decision support tools, enterprise scheduling products, master-patient index tools, and managed care information systems. Clinical products include clinical repositories, clinical workstations, and point-of-care devices.
 </UL><BR><UL><LI>
The proliferation of IDNs has accelerated the adoption of new open systems capable of cost-effectively accommodating a growing number of users and interfacing with legacy systems.  These increased levels of scaleability and openness are achieved primarily through client-server based systems. Client-server architecture maximizes an enterprise's IT price/performance ratio and can support the distribution of all information throughout the enterprise.  However, this architecture is also more difficult to develop, implement, and support and imparts a premium on the HCIS vendors' systems integration and process reengineering services organization.</UL>
<P>
<B><I>The high-end of the market is increasingly controlling the IT dollar.</I></B>
<P>
<UL><LI> As the industry consolidates, the larger, market-leading HCIS vendors are benefiting as their larger clients integrate with smaller organizations requiring new systems and services.</UL>
 <P><UL><LI>
Given these industry dynamics, our criteria for picking winners include (i) a large and satisfied installed base to reference and cross-sell, preferably at the high-end of the market; (ii) support for open, client-server architectures; (iii) a broad suite of applications including newer ones such as managed care, enterprise-wide, and decision support systems; and (iv) a large service organization capable of offering higher level consulting services such as systems integration and process reengineering. By these standards, IDX's fundamentals are among the strongest in the HCIS universe and we expect IDX to establish a leadership position in the evolving IDN market.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
In the last year, IMNET has posted revenue growth of over 200% and has reinforced its leadership position in the electronic information and document management segment of the healthcare information services industry (HCIS). IMNET has also significantly strengthened its Electronic Information Warehouse (EIW) product line through three acquisitions and has won the endorsement of several leading HCIS companies which have agreed to exclusive distribution arrangements with the Company. IMNET's channel relationships give it preferred access to over 2700 hospitals and to about 60% of the large group practice market. 
<P>
For an encore in FY97, we expect IMNET to (i) generate 89% top-line and triple-digit earnings growth through increased penetration of the healthcare market; (ii) develop alliances with additional HCIS vendors, provider organizations, and non-healthcare channels; and (iii) continue to strengthen its product offerings both through acquisition and through internal development.
<P>
<B><I>Investment Highlights</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>Driven by the need to reduce overhead and improve operations, the electronic information and document management segment of the healthcare industry represents a $5 billion market opportunity. In the 1996 annual Health Information and Management Systems Society's (HIMSS) leadership survey, healthcare purchasing managers responded that one of their top healthcare automation priorities was the automation of the patient record. IMNET's EIW product line, which manages documents, medical images, and structured data from within one integrated framework, represents a critical enabling component of this effort.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
With the broadest and most open solution targeted to the healthcare industry, and the largest "blue chip" customer base of any direct competitor, IMNET is the clear leader in the healthcare electronic information and document management market. While a number of smaller competitors have cropped up over the last year, IMNET remains the premier player in the healthcare industry, effectively dominating the high-end of the market, and establishing a virtual "lock" on healthcare distribution channels.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
IMNET has used its strong product position to develop a formidable distribution channel. The Company has strategic alliances with leading HCIS vendors, including HBO & Company, Cerner, Citation, IDX Systems, Phamis, and OrNda. Together, these companies represent over 50% of the U.S. hospital market or over 2,800 distinct hospitals.</UL>
<P>
<B><I> Documents and Medical Images are Integral to the CPR</I></B>
<P>
<UL><LI>

IMNET's EIW consolidates all information within a healthcare enterprise and provides a complete information management solution by integrating current and historical information, regardless of storage media.  The solution, comprised of IMNET's Image Engine, Workflow Engine, Electronic Patient Record System, MedVision products, LaserArc, and MegaSAR, allows organizations to capture, store, retrieve, and manage information originated and stored on virtually all storage media.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>

As healthcare provider organizations confront mounting pressure to reduce their cost structure, cost-justifiable technologies like IMNET's EIW are becoming an increasing imperative. By implementing EIW, healthcare institutions can significantly reduce warehousing and personnel costs, shorten the billing cycle through improved workflow management, and provide the framework for an electronic patient record capable of integrating structured and unstructured medical, financial, and administrative data.  

</UL><BR><UL><LI>

With 52 contracted hospital clients and a number of large "blue chip" reference sites, IMNET has reached the critical mass necessary to raise EIW's profile as a viable and increasingly mainstream alternative to paper document management for the largest of healthcare institutions.  
The primary drivers behind IMNET's spectacular growth have been (i) the Company's tremendous marketing prowess, (ii) its outstanding technology, and (iii) the degree to which the Company's products provide "hard dollar" savings to hospitals that are both tangible and quantifiable.  Exhibit 2 represents the savings and return-on-investment as measured by actual IMNET clients.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
"Hard dollar" savings result from reduced length of stay, the elimination of duplicate tests, improved outcomes, and from improved cashflow from shorter billing cycles.  Additional intangible, or "soft dollar," benefits include improved access to information, which translates into increased productivity throughout the enterprise.

<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first half of the year has been extremely eventful for the Internet and those companies (and investors) whose fortunes are tied to it.  The euphoria in November, following Fall Internet World in Boston, was followed by skepticism at the turn of the year, with many Internet-related stocks falling more than 50% from their highs.  However, perhaps coincident with PointCast's spread to desktops everywhere, the sector staged a rebound, as stocks retraced much of their losses and several more Internet pure-plays accessed the public markets with resoundingly successful IPOs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><P>
<B><I>A brief review of events.</I></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Here come the advertising dollars.</B>  The four public search engines (Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, and Yahoo) reported combined advertising revenues of over $5 million in Q1:96. Not a bad performance, with the slight caveat that they collectively paid Netscape $20 million (for CY:96) to direct eyeballs (and therefore revenues) to their sites.  Recently filed Internet content provider c|net had first-quarter ad revenues (at c/net.com) of approximately $1 million. PointCast, the hit of the Spring Internet World tradeshow, may eventually be bigger than them all.  PointCast delivers news and targeted advertising (more on this later) to the desktops of its users, which effectively enables advertisers to penetrate the office environment for the first time, a remarkable achievement.
<P>
Recent developments seem to suggest that advertising is far from a foolproof business model for purveyors of content on the Web; first, you've got to have the eyeballs.  For example, Web Review, which publishes news about the Internet exclusively on the World Wide Web, recently announced that the site will be shuttered if users don't begin paying subscription fees.  Many more advertising-supported content sites, lacking the brand name recognition of Yahoo! or PointCast's premier position on the desktop, may be in for difficult days ahead, or may eventually find themselves supported by subscription or pay-per-view models.
<P>
We expect Internet advertising to become considerably more sophisticated over the next 12 months, thanks to innovations from such vendors as NetGravity, Focalink, CyberGold and inquiry.com.
<P>
<B>Internet access is valuable.</B>  Or at least MFS Communications, a leading competitive access provider, thinks so.  MFS agreed to acquire UUNet, the leading commercial Internet service provider (ISP), for over $2.0 billion in stock.  Other ISPs, including NETCOM, appeared to gain on investor expectations that AT&T, MCI or one of the RBOCs would also make an aggressive "buy-not-build" foray into Internet access.  In another significant event, AOL moved to lower its prices to more closely match ISP pricing, perhaps indicating that its slowing growth was the result of people moving away from expensive, proprietary, on-line services to the Internet.
<P>
In addition to the obvious implications for the ISP marketplace, the MFS/UUNet deal stands as a major legitimization of the Internet.  Although several software companies have spent considerable R&D and M&A dollars on Internet applications, this transaction marks the first time a company from the traditional communications or software infrastructure has made such a significant bet on the Net's future.
<P>
<B>Strategic Mergers.</B> While the UUNet merger was the only instance of a public company being purchased, many public companies are using their valuable stock to acquire private firms.  Netscape's acquisitions of Collabra, InSoft, Netcode, and Paper Software; Microsoft's buys of Vermeer and Aspect; and Macromedia's purchase of iband are indicative of deals that are setting the stage for major battles in the Internet tools arena.  On the private company side, Software.com and Accordance joined to form a company that will challenge the dominance of Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange in e-mail and messaging, a function that is expected to boast approximately 250 million end-users (virtually everyone with a personal computing device) by the year 2000.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>...and a look ahead at major trends for the remainder of the year</B></I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>The Continued Development of Corporate Intranets.</B>  A recent study indicated that two-thirds of companies had installed an intranet or were preparing to do so within the year.  Why?  Quite simply, intranets have the ability to link disparate databases, business applications, and other information stores to make the complete knowledge base of a corporation available to any (authorized) user at the click of a mouse.  When combined with external Internet access, the user has access to the vast resources of a networked planet, enabling unprecedented opportunities for information exchange and collaborative work.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>The number of people who use the Internet to communicate and share information electronically is expected to grow at a 62.4% compound rate over the next 6 years reaching approximately 550 million in the year 2000.  This explosive growth will result in the creation of new Internet-related markets and exciting investment opportunities in companies that provide (i) Internet access, (ii) software tools for navigating and publishing information, (iii) services based on Internet expertise, (iv) tools and services facilitating electronic commerce on the Net, and (v) other new applications.
<P>
<B><I>Executive Summary</I></B>
<P>
The information revolution is here
1994 was the year the Internet burst onto the scene.  Stories about the Internet appeared in virtually every major publication from the covers of Time Magazine and Business Week to almost weekly articles in the New York Times.  Politicians from both the conservative right (Newt Gingrich) and the liberal left (Al Gore) used the Internet to reach out to their constituencies and drum up support for their policies.  Performers got into the act with David Letterman's "top ten" list available on  the World Wide Web on a daily basis, and the Rolling Stones broadcasting the first live rock concert on the Internet.  Finally, the investment community signaled its interest by placing bets on companies whose businesses were related to the Internet like Ascend Communications (+172% in 1994), America Online (+92% in 1994), and NetManage (+120% in 1994), culminating in the very successful IPO in December of NETCOM (+118% in December 1994), the first pure play Internet access provider.
<P>
Early in 1995 CBS devoted a lead segment on 60 minutes to the Internet and both IBM and MCI ran TV ads promoting their Internet businesses during Super Bowl XXIX.   Plans are currently being made for a World's Fair in Cyberspace scheduled to be held in 1996, which is being sponsored by the Clinton administration as well as a number of companies and private organizations.
<P>
Despite the media hype, and the temptation to dismiss it as just the latest fad, the Internet is experiencing explosive growth that is creating new business and investment opportunities at an incredible pace. According to the Internet Society, the number of computer networks on the Net in January 1995 was 46,318 and is expected to grow to 194,822 by October of 1996 (see Exhibit 2).  We estimate that there were 30 million users on the Internet worldwide at the end of 1994, and we expect the number of users to increase at a 62.4% compound growth rate to 550 million by 2000.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points and Conclusions</I></B>
<P><UL><LI>
The explosive growth of the Internet will create a burgeoning market for services and software that we expect will increase from approximately $370 million in 1994 to an estimated $5.8 billion in 2000, a compound growth rate of 62.4%.
</UL><UL><LI> 
The market can be segmented into five categories:  (i)  Internet access, (ii)  Software tools for navigating and creating a presence on the Internet, (iii)  Services based on Internet expertise, (iv)  Products and services for conducting electronic commerce on the Net, (v)  Other Internet applications.
</UL><UL><LI> 
The first major Internet business opportunity is providing Internet access to businesses and consumers.  We expect this market segment to increase from approximately $150 million in 1994 to an estimated $2.5 billion in 2000, a compound growth rate of 59.8%.
 
</UL><UL><LI>The second commercial opportunity is selling Internet software.  We expect this market segment to increase from approximately $150 million in 1994 to an estimated $1.6 billion in 2000, a compound growth rate of 48.4%.
 
</UL><UL><LI> Due to the complexities of managing all of the different technologies relating to the Internet, most companies will choose to out-source the fulfillment of their Internet needs to businesses with specific Internet expertise.  We estimate that this third market segment will grow from approximately $60 million in 1994 to an estimated $750 million in 2000, a compound growth rate of 52.3%.
 
</UL><UL><LI> Various types of electronic commerce will play a major role in the Net's evolution as existing paper, phone, and fax based business and consumer transactions are moved to the Internet.  We expect the market for Internet commerce software tools and services to increase from approximately $5 million in 1994 to an estimated $625 million in 2000, a compound growth rate of 123.6%.
 
</UL><UL><LI> Other potential applications will emerge as voice, music, video, animation and intelligent agent technologies are incorporated into the Internet.  We estimate the market for these applications and content will increase from approximately $5 million in 1994 to an estimated $325 million in 2000, a compound growth rate of 100.5%.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Itron is the leading supplier of data acquisition and wireless communications systems to the utility industry. We think Itron will benefit from accelerating demand for its Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) products and services as utilities seek to reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and identify new business opportunities in response to deregulation and increased competition.<P>
<B><I> More Downward Revisions; Q3:96 Loss on the Way
</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
Itron announced that Q3:96 revenue will fall well below expectations, leading to a loss of $0.10-$0.15 EPS for the quarter vs. our forecast of a gain of $0.17. The Company also revised FY:1997 expectations sharply downward.  The above table includes our reworked projections.
<P>
While this marks the latest in a string of downward revisions for Itron's financial performance over the last year, we are maintaining our BUY(2) rating for the following reasons.</UL>
<P><UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
i) The macro-drivers for the automatic meter reading (AMR) market remain compelling, with looming deregulation pushing the utilities toward AMR investments.
<P>
ii) While the downward revisions in part reflect slippages in customer deployments, they are also the result of a changing revenue model for the Company.  Going forward, the undetermined balance between outsourcing and purchase contracts makes revenue timing and size projections equivalent to rolling dice. This suggests that investors should be prepared for further gyrations in financial performance, and that valuation parameters need to incorporate the long-term (10-15 years) revenue streams that outsourcing agreements entail.
<P>
iii) Itron's valuation appears very attractive relative to CellNet Data Systems (CNDS - $15 3/4), which just went public on September 27, 1996 at an $810 million valuation (see below). </BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
<UL><LI>
Other indicators, including trends in committed customers and backlog, are strong, justifying Itron's continued investment in fixed network systems and the recent expansion of the sales and marketing organization. Also, the Company continues to project that several major contracts will be signed before year-end. </UL>
<P>
<B><I>
$40 Million Contract Win from People's Gas & Light</I></B>
<BR><UL><LI>
On September 23, 1996, Itron announced a mobile AMR contract with People's Gas, a subsidiary of People's Energy Corp. (NYSE - PGL $34).  The $40 million order for 750,000 ERTs will be installed over the next four to six years. On top of People's present installation of 90,000 units, this will expand the AMR system to cover the utility's entire residential customer base in Chicago. The meters will be read using van-based mobile receivers, with a potential transition to a fixed network system. Initially, 5,000 ERTs will be covered by a fixed network so People's can evaluate the technology over the coming year.
</UL>
<B><I>Itron Valuation Attractive Relative to CellNet</I></B>
<BR>
<UL><LI>The following are key differentiators between Itron and CellNet Data Systems:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
i) Customer base. Cellnet has three major customers, all of whom have equity positions in the Company. Itron has over 240 customers, 50 of whom have more than 10,000 units installed.<P>

ii) The breadth and depth of Itron's technology. Itron has developed ERTs (Encoder-Receiver-Transmitters - the wireless transceivers that are attached to meters) for electric, gas, and water meters for industrial, commercial, and residential applications. To date, CellNet has only deployed units for residential electric meters. Also, Itron can offer utilities the most cost-effective combination of four automatic meter reading technologies: landline, handheld, mobile, and fixed network. CellNet has fixed network systems only. For example, reading 85% with a fixed network and 15% with a combination of mobile and handheld units is often much more economical than extending a fixed network to reach 100% of meters in a given territory.
<P>
iii) Revenue model. Itron's revenue model is based on selling AMR equipment or outsourcing deals that are profitable from meter reading alone. CellNet has only entered into outsourcing deals (no equipment sales to date), and is counting on ancillary revenue sources on top of meter-reading to make its business model work. Applications like home alarm, vending machine, and traffic light monitoring can be layered on to fixed network systems. However, many utilities are considering offering such services themselves, which entails purchasing the system outright or revenue-sharing agreements for outsourcing (e.g., Itron's outsourcing deal with Duquesne).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Macromedia is the leading provider of software tools for the creation of digital multimedia content.  The dominant provider of tools for PC and CD-ROM applications, Macromedia in the last 12 months has aggressively positioned itself to extend its leadership status to Internet/intranet applications. 
<P>
Despite upgrades to much of its product line in the March 1996 quarter, including the flagship Director and Director Multimedia Studio, the Company achieved sequential revenue growth of 1.2% and (11.4%) in the June and September quarters, respectively.  This revenue weakness translated to the bottom line, with EPS in each of those quarters falling below results achieved in March.
<P>
In our opinion, Macromedia's declining results are the result of three confluent trends.  First, the market for 2D graphics has slowed considerably, with growth likely falling below 10% per year, and as such, revenues from FreeHand and FreeHand Graphics Studio, which we estimate accounted for approximately 25% of Macromedia's FY:96 revenues, will likely be flat in FY:97.  Second, the growth of multimedia CD-ROM products, which historically have represented a large constituency of Macromedia users, are suffering through the economic realities of retail consumer software, resulting in significant consolidation and the failure of many smaller publishers.  Lastly, the Company's bundling strategy, while important for its goal of long-term market dominance, has served to cannibalize revenues from secondary products such as Extreme 3D.
<P>
While we remain fundamentally bullish on the long-term growth prospects for rich multimedia content generally, and Macromedia specifically, we believe short-term results will continue to be disappointing.  Despite significant architectural advances, including the MMX chip from Intel and 56k modems from U.S. Robotics, it will be some time before multimedia publishing on the Web compensates for the slowdowns in the graphics and retail CD-ROM markets.  Accordingly, we expect Macromedia to experience unexciting EPS comparisons for several quarters and rate the stock a NEUTRAL (3).

<P>
<B><I> The Leader in Digital Multimedia </B></I><P>

Macromedia's broad line of authoring tools address all the key areas of digital media - multimedia authoring, graphics, audio, Web publishing, and (in spring 1997) digital video.  Macromedia has therefore been ideally positioned to benefit from the explosive increase in digital multimedia in entertainment and corporate applications.  We believe, however, that we have arrived at a critical inflection point in the market.  Graphics professionals and retail CD-ROM developers, who to date have represented a significant percentage of the Company's user base and have been the primary drivers of the growth in the volume of digital multimedia content, have seen their growth slow considerably.  Meanwhile, the World Wide Web, the next major medium for multimedia content development, remains dominated by static, HTML-based content, and therefore has been unable to compensate for the slowing growth of these markets.  Therefore, while from a longer-term perspective we expect the use of digital multimedia to resume its explosive growth (with Web bandwidth enhancement and digital video disk likely to be key drivers), and expect  Macromedia to be a key beneficiary, we believe the short-term outlook calls for caution.<P>

<B><I>A Slowdown in Some of  Macromedia's Market Segments...</I></B><P>
<UL><LI><B>
Graphics.</B>  The market for 2D graphics, addressed by Freehand and FreeHand Graphics Studio, has slowed considerably in recent months; growth is likely below 10% per year at this juncture.  We estimate that revenue contribution from the FreeHand product line was approximately $35 million in FY:96, and that growth will be 0-5% in FY:97.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Multimedia CD-ROM.</B>  Macromedia is far and away the leading producer of authoring tools for multimedia CD-ROMS - we estimate that over 50% of all titles were created using Macromedia tools.  The retail CD-ROM industry, however, has come under significant pressure in the last year, as too many titles have been chasing too little shelf space.  This has led to massive industry consolidation (Softkey/Learning Company, IBM/Edmark, GT Interactive/Humongous). More importantly, the number of small developers-who used to represent a core customer group for Macromedia -has dramatically diminished.  Reason:  the high cost of creating quality titles, and the unfavorable economics of distributing them. Our research indicates that as few as 5% of the current 10,000 titles are profitable. Consumers will spend an estimated 40% less on CD-ROM titles this Christmas than last, which was hardly a robust holiday season for CD-ROM developers.  Therefore, while overall Director and Director Multimedia Studio sales remain strong, this section of that market (perhaps representing 15-20% of Director users) is slowing.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Secondary products.</B>  Macromedia sells several "secondary" products, including Extreme 3D, xRes, Fontographer and SoundEdit 16.  In FY:96, Macromedia instituted an aggressive bundling strategy, combining its flagship Director, FreeHand and Authorware products with these secondary products to form "suites," with standardized user interfaces and a common architectural framework for easy product integration.  While this strategy has served Macromedia's long-term objective to consolidate control of the multimedia market, giving developers all the tools they would need, it has served in the short term to cannibalize sales of those secondary products.  Thus, with suite sales reaching 60% of total revenues, we expect these secondary products, which contributed approximately $10 million in revenue in FY:96, to be flat in FY:97.</UL><P>

<B><I>...Has not Yet Been Recovered
By Growth in the Web Publishing</I></B><P>
<UL><LI>
The amount of content on the Web has obviously been growing at an astounding rate.  Alta Vista claims to have indexed 30 million pages of information; over 400 terabytes of data pass through the major network access points (NAPs) each month (up from 50 million in August 1995).  This trend shows no sign of slowing; in fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that it has accelerated in recent months.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Not surprisingly, many people and companies previously engaged in the CD-ROM business are now actively attacking Internet development, either through hybrid Web/CD-ROM applications or Web-only content.  Others have begun creating websites for the many corporations hoping to pitch their wares in cyberspace.  Last year, Macromedia wisely sought to leverage its 400,000-plus customer base by creating Shockwave and acquiring iband's BackStage product line, to provide these developers with sophisticated Internet tools.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
MedQuist Inc. is the largest "pure play" company specializing in the outsourcing of medical record transcription services - a $6 billion segment of the healthcare business management services industry.  
With over 400 leading healthcare clients,  nearly 100% client retention, major market forces in healthcare driving demand for the Company's core services, and excellent technology and competitive advantages, we expect strong growth in the Company's earnings.  Given these powerful fundamentals, we rate the stock <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> with a $34 12-month price target.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI><B>Transcription Services.</B> A Rapidly Growing Segment of the HCIS Market Several market forces effecting healthcare organizations 3/4 primarily increasing regulatory and accrediting reporting requirements, pressures to speed billing processes and improve cash flow, and  widespread growth in the use of computer-based patient records 3/4 are working together to increase demand for medical transcription management services to hospitals and physicians.  Today, transcription services account for about $6 billion in healthcare expenditures with 15-20% annual market growth expected through the year 2000.  We think MedQuist, one of the largest and best known companies serving the industry, will be a major beneficiary of this rapid market expansion.</UL>
 <UL>
<LI><B>Major Trends in Transcription Services.</B>  Outsourcing and Consolidation  Within the transcription services industry two main trends are clear: (i) transcription service providers are consolidating, and (ii) the use of outsourcing services is rising.  As the only publicly traded "pure play" company in this segment, MedQuist has tremendous opportunities for both internal growth and growth through acquisition.</UL>
 <UL>
<LI><B> The Computer-Based Patient Record Increases Demand for Transcription Services.</B>  Transcription services are integral to providers' efforts to implement computer-based patient record (CPR) systems, also referred to as electronic medical record systems.  According to Healthcare Information Management System Society (HIMSS) surveys and other market research, implementation of computer-based patient record systems is one of the industry's most important priorities, and will represent the top area of capital expenditure in healthcare over the next several years.  Accordingly, demand for transcription services should ride on the coattails of the growth of the CPR market.</UL>
 <UL>
<LI><B> Market and Technology Leadership.</B> MedQuist has developed proprietary software systems and reporting, tracking, and distribution systems that (i) provide the most comprehensive transcription system available that can grow with organizations ranging from individual departments to the largest of integrated delivery environments, and (ii) make it the most cost-effective transcription service provider in the industry with the highest client retention rates and outstanding operating performance. We think the Company's technology gives it a major competitive advantage.</UL>
 <UL>
<LI><B>Solid Fundamentals</B> MedQuist has a demonstrated ability to grow both internally and through acquisition; substantially improve existing operations; develop proprietary software systems; cultivate and retain a large client base of over 400 healthcare organizations, including many of the most well-known hospitals and integrated delivery systems in the U.S. (e.g., the University of Pennsylvania, Duke, Brigham & Women's Hospital Cambridge, Intermountain Heath Systems, Cigna); generate excellent visibility and recurring revenues; and cross-sell to its existing client base.  These fundamentals contribute to our expectations for outstanding financial performance and give the Company a strong base for future strategic initiatives in the HCIS sector.  </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
In 1996, compressed margins in the commercial business and inadequate premiums and high medical utilization in the Medicare segment will result in Mid Atlantic Medical's first full-year operating loss in ten years. The Company has made progress toward correcting problems in its commercial and Medicare businesses. However, as the pricing and cost picture for 1997 begins to solidify, we think that the restoration of the Company's operating margins to near-historical levels is at least a year away. We no longer believe that the Company will be able to achieve profitability in Q4:96, but think a modest recovery is possible for 1997. We are lowering our Q4:96 EPS estimate to ($0.06) from $0.03, and cutting our FY97 estimate by $0.55 to $0.35. We continue to rate the shares NEUTRAL (3).

<P><BR>
<B><I> Medicare: Abandoning the Most Unprofitable Areas
</B></I>
<P><UL><LI>
The Company's Medicare business accounts for just 2% of fully-insured lives and only 5% of FY96 premium revenues, but will be responsible for a loss of approximately $0.20 per share in 1996. In total, the Company's MLR in the Medicare segment has approached 140% in the first nine months of 1996. Effective January 1, 1997, Mid Atlantic Medical will withdraw from the Medicare risk market in 57 counties, thereby disenrolling roughly 5,500 senior members. HCFA reimbursement in the affected areas averages approximately $330 pmpm, but the medical costs associated with these members has surpassed $400 pmpm. Although almost 40% of Mid Atlantic's Medicare membership will be given up, we estimate that the move will positively impact the Company's bottom line by about $0.10 per share next year. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
In addition to the regional realignment, Mid Atlantic has hired 20 case managers to focus on controlling the medical costs of the Company's 1,700 highest-acuity Medicare cases. Six months ago, only 300 members had been assigned a case manager. Now, senior enrollees are also given health-risk assessment surveys to identify their health risks as they join the HMO - not when they show up at the emergency room.</UL>
<P><BR>
<B><I> Medicare: Lackluster Enrollment Growth Expected to Continue </B></I>
<P>
<UL><LI>Despite having the largest HMO presence in its service area, the Company's Medicare risk product rollout has been disappointing. In 1996, the Company's monthly membership gain has averaged less than 800 new enrollees. Mid Atlantic's three competitors in Maryland have not performed much better, adding an average of about 615 new seniors per month. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI>We think that the lack of market response to the efforts of these plans can be partially attributed to the inexperience of providers in effectively managing the medical costs of the senior population in the State. The combination of a high cost structure and relatively low premiums has not provided the stimulus necessary for any HMO to aggressively penetrate the Medicare market in Maryland. We don't expect a substantial improvement in enrollment growth during 1997, as the Company is now focusing its sales efforts on a much smaller marketing area - those counties with HCFA reimbursement well above $400 pmpm. </UL>
<P><BR>
<B><I> Medicaid: A Sad Tale of Two States</B></I>
<P>
<UL><LI>
In a year of disappointments, Mid Atlantic Medical's lack of Medicaid enrollment growth 1996 has only added to the pain. As we look to 1997, it is possible that the Company will be forced to pare back its participation in the Medicaid segment even more.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
The State of Virginia currently operates two HMO Medicaid programs: a mandated plan in the Tidewater region that currently covers 93,000 Medicaid recipients and an optional program in the rest of the State that covers approximately 34,000 lives. Mid Atlantic Medical, which has a 57% share of the optional statewide program, received a 4-5% premium increase for those lives, effective July 1, 1996. We believe this program makes a reasonable contribution to operating earnings.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Virginia is currently seeking material reductions in premium rates with those health plans, including Mid Atlantic Medical, that are participating in the Tidewater HMO mandate. Approximately 56% of the Company's Virginia Medicaid membership is affected. Due to the proposed cuts, Mid Atlantic notified the State that it would be withdrawing from the Tidewater program, effective January 1, 1997. As a result, Virginia has indicated a willingness to negotiate, requesting a counteroffer from Mid Atlantic. The Company submitted its newest proposal on December 2, and we expect a resolution to this crisis very shortly. There is still a good possibility that Mid Atlantic will exit the Tidewater program, but the State's recent flexibility is encouraging.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
A similar situation is brewing in Maryland. The State has received a Section 1115 waiver to operate a mandated Medicaid HMO program, effective January 1, 1996. About 225,000 Medicaid recipients will be required to choose a participating HMO or will be enrolled in one by the State. Maryland has indicated that it wants to rollback premiums by 15% and increase the benefits offered to Medicaid recipients under the mandate. As in Virginia, we think that a substantial number of providers would walk away from the Maryland Medicaid program if forced to absorb a 15% rate cut.   
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Mid Atlantic Medical currently covers approximately 44,000 Medicaid lives in Maryland. Management has been frank in its discussions with the State, indicating that it will disenroll its current Medicaid membership and won't participate in the mandate if the premium cuts are implemented. The Company is working with the State to reach a solution, even suggesting a profit-sharing arrangement. We think that competing HMOs have similar issues with the State, which will likely delay the rollout of the mandate beyond January. Due to this uncertainty and the wide range of possible outcomes, we are assuming no growth in Medicaid enrollment in 1997.</UL><P>
<BR>
<B><I> Commercial Price Increases Should Provide Margin Relief</I></B><P>

<UL><LI>
Based on indications from the current open enrollment season, we think that Mid Atlantic Medical will receive an average commercial premium increase of 6% for business that renews January 1, 1997. Net premium increases of this magnitude are likely through the balance of 1997 as well. If the Company can hold per member medical cost increases to 3% or less, the new premium structure will go a long way toward rebuilding a normal (5-7% operating margin) level of profitability. We therefore expect commercial margins to improve slowly, but steadily, as 1997 progresses. 
</UL><BR><UL><LI>
Management has become more disciplined in its pricing strategy and has demonstrated its willingness to walk away from unprofitable business in 2H:96. However, we don't expect the price hikes to hurt commercial enrollment growth too much, as the Company's competitors - blindsided by the same adverse medical cost trends as Mid Atlantic Medical - have also been raising premiums. We think that the Company will add 35,000 new commercial lives during the first quarter of 1997.</UL>

<I><B>Investment Thesis</B></I>
<P>
MySoftware is a leading provider of sales and marketing software for small businesses, including home-based businesses.  We expect MySoftware's revenues to grow at least 45% annually over the next three years and long-term earnings growth of 35%.  In 12 months, we expect MYSW to trade at approximately 30 times our preliminary CY97 EPS estimate of $0.85 - $0.95, which suggests a $25 stock.<BR><P>
<I><B>Summary Points</B></I>
<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Task-specific products for small businesses.</B> MySoftware is a leading provider of desktop sales and marketing solutions designed to help customers generate more business.  Studies indicate that the most important concern small businesses have is getting more business.  MySoftware's products, which fall into four product categories -- brochures, mailing, labeling, and invoicing/estimates -- are designed to address this concern by providing desktop solutions that help businesses project a more professional image and do a better job of communicating with customers.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Large and growing market.</B> Over 80% of the businesses in the U.S. employ fewer than 10 people (6.8 million small businesses).  In 1994 an estimated $1.3 billion was spend on software by small businesses.  We expect the market to grow considerably, driven by growing user familiarity with computers, increasing PC penetration of small businesses, and the emergence of a retail channel that serves small businesses.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Market-leading products.</B> MySoftware has the #1 market share in three of its four product categories.  The products score higher on ease of use than other leading software products in the small business and home business market.

</UL><UL><LI><B>Focused strategy.</B> MySoftware's strategy is to be the leading provider of sales and marketing software for small businesses.  We expect this focused strategy to enable MySoftware to maintain its status as the market leader.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Strong distribution.</B> MySoftware's products are in over 7,000 retail outlets, including Office Depot, Office Max, and Staples.  Products are sold to distributors as well as direct to retailers.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Projected revenue growth in excess of 45%.</B> For FY94 (Dec.), MySoftware reported $9.2 million in revenue.  We estimate that for FY95 and FY96, MySoftware will generate revenue of $14.4 million (+56%) and $21.2 million (+47%).</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Strong growth in operating income.</B> Strong revenue growth and expanding operating margins will drive operating income from $1.4 million in 1994 to $2.5 million (+77%) and $4.0 million (+59%) in 1995 and 1996 respectively.  EPS are estimated to increase from $0.26 in 1994 to $0.49 (+89%) in 1995 and $0.63 (+29%) in 1996.  Earnings growth is expected to be strong despite an increase of 24% in shares outstanding over the two-year period.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Attractive valuation.</B> Despite strong revenue and earnings growth, MySoftware is selling at only 20 times our 1996 EPS estimate.  In twelve months, we think the stock will trade at 30 times our preliminary CY97 EPS estimate of $0.85 - $0.95, which suggests a $25 stock.</UL>

<I><B>Investment Thesis</B></I>
<BR><P>
We expect NETCOM, a leading Internet connectivity provider, to generate revenue and subscriber growth of 160% and 180% respectively during 1995.  Based on our estimate of 180,000 subscribers at the end of 1995, we are initiating coverage with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendation.<BR><P>

<I><B>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>

<LI><B>NETCOM is a leading Internet connectivity provider. </B> Using a computer equipped with a modem, or attached to a local area network with a  dedicated phone line, a NETCOM subscriber can obtain access to the Internet's vast and expanding communication, information, entertainment and computer resources, as well as its emerging commercial applications.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
The Internet is experiencing explosive growth.</B> There were approximately 16 million Internet users at the end of 1993.  It is estimated that the number of users more than doubled to 36 million during 1994.  By 1997, IDC estimates there will be 128 million worldwide Internet users.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>NETCOM is experiencing even more rapid subscriber growth.</B> NETCOM's subscriber base has grown from 11,400 subscribers on 12/31/93 to 41,500 subscribers at 9/30/94.  We estimate NETCOM will have 64,000 subscribers on 12/31/94, 180,000 subscribers on 12/31/95, and 355,000 subscribers on 12/31/96.</UL><UL><LI>

<B>Revenue growth is expected to keep pace with subscriber growth.</B> We estimate that revenue will increase from $2.4 million in 1993, to an estimated $11.7 million for 1994, $30.7 million for 1995, and $64 million for 1996.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
NETCOM's affordable, and easy to use NetCruiser service is driving this rapid growth.</B> With the introduction of NetCruiser software (a Windows-based, point and click navigation tool) in July 1994, NETCOM offers an easy to use, affordable ($19.95/month) complete solution for individuals who want to "get on the Net."</UL>

<UL><LI><B>NETCOM operates its own Proprietary Network.</B> NETCOM's network is comprised of a backbone of leased high speed dedicated data lines (T-3 and T-1 lines), computer software and hardware, and local access points or POPs (Points of Presence).  A POP allows a subscriber to access the Internet through a local telephone call.  There were 51 POPs in operation on 12/31/94, and we expect there to be 130 POPs by 12/31/95.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Recurring Revenue Model.</B> NETCOM charges monthly subscriber fees ranging from $19.95 per month for a NetCruiser account to $1,000 per month for a high speed dedicated line account.  In most cases monthly subscription fees are automatically charged directly to a user's credit card account.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Optical Sensors, Inc. has developed a breakthrough approach to measuring arterial blood gases (ABGs) in critically ill patients. Fast, accurate, and frequent ABG results are essential to guide the treatment of patients in the operating room (OR) and intensive care unit (ICU). We expect significant appreciation in Optical Sensors' stock as the product is rolled out in the U.S. market over the next year. The company has the potential to leverage its fiber-optic technology platform to create new products and alliances, which will enhance the company's future value. We are initiating coverage of Optical Sensors with a <B>BUY (2)</B> rating and a 12-month price target of $20. 
<P>
<B><I>Introduction</I></B>
<P>
Arterial-blood-gas (ABG) tests measure oxygen, carbon dioxide, and acid-base (pH) in the bloodstream - key indicators of a patient's health status and respiratory condition. ABG tests are the most frequently requested and urgently needed diagnostic procedure for seriously ill patients in the hospital. Under current ABG testing procedures, the time required to draw blood and analyze it can compromise the quality of care for medically unstable patients. Furthermore, current testing methods place both patients and healthcare workers at risk of infection.
<P>
Optical Sensors has developed a noninvasive, cost-effective solution to these problems.  The product, the SensiCath System, uses fluorescent optical sensors to measure blood gases. The SensiCath System received 510(k) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration on January 16, 1996. The product was introduced at the annual meeting of the Society of Critical Care Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana, February 5-9, 1996. The company is just beginning to roll out the product in conjunction with its marketing partner, Marquette Electronics, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient bedside monitoring systems.
<P>
The SensiCath System was designed to be attached to existing patient- monitoring systems to provide accurate, on-demand ABG results within 60 seconds without permanently removing blood from the patient. The SensiCath System is the first arterial blood gas analyzer that will be integrated into both an arterial pressure monitoring line and a critical care monitoring system. 
<P>
Optical Sensors' target market is the approximately 1.4 million critically ill, unstable patients in the U.S. who require frequent ABG testing. This figure represents a market opportunity of around $343 million annually for the disposable components of the SensiCath System in the U.S. alone.

Optika's long-term revenue growth of 40% will be driven by: i) its FilePower integrated product suite, ii) its MediPower product suite targeted at the healthcare vertical market, and iii) a large, dedicated, and growing worldwide VAR network.  We are initiating coverage with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> rating and a price target of $9.


<P><BR>
<B><I> Summary Points</I></B>
<P><BR>
<UL><LI><B>
Optika is a leading player in the growing imaging, workflow, and COLD software market.</B>  We expect the combined market for imaging, workflow, and COLD software for both UNIX and Windows NT to grow at a compound annual rate of 30% through 1998.  Since introducing the fully-integrated FilePower product suite, Optika has grown revenue better than 55% in Q1:96 and Q2:96. </UL>
<UL><LI><B>
The FilePower suite was introduced in August of 1995.</B>  This was the industry's first easy-to-install, fully-integrated product suite for imaging, workflow, and COLD.  It is offered at a lower price point (at times 48% lower) than competitive products and can scale up from the workgroup to the enterprise.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

FilePower, optimized to work on Windows NT, is therefore aligned with the growth in NT.</B>  Gartner Group expects the NT market to grow from 100 million units in 1994 to 1.2 billion units in 1998, a compound annual growth rate of 86%.  The UNIX market is expected to grow at only 12% over this same time period.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

Optika's first vertical market application - called MediPower -  is for the healthcare market.</B>  Built on top of the core FilePower product, this application manages electronic medical records.  We expect Optika to initially cross-sell MediPower to the 80 plus hospitals that currently use FilePower for patient accounting.  
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

The best and most experienced VAR channel.</B>  Scott McCready (IDC) believes Optika's VAR channel is the best in the industry.  The company has built up over 180 Optika Business Solution Partners (BSPs) to leverage the sale of its software products.  It is expanding this channel to international markets and is also beginning to develop an OEM channel.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

Optika has the ideal business model for today's market.</B>  If a new software company in this industry were created today, it would:  i) leverage a VAR channel by creating a fully-integrated product suite that is easy for VARs to install and easy for them to configure for vertical applications, ii) provide a less expensive product than the competition, iii) provide a product that is scaleable from the workgroup to the enterprise, and iv) provide a product that is positioned to catch the wave of Windows NT.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

Rapid revenue growth.</B>  Reported revenue for the first six months of 1996 was $6.96 million versus $4.43 million in the first six months of 1995, a 57% increase.  We estimate revenue for FY:96 will be $16.5 million and for FY:97, $24 million.  FY:98 estimated revenue is $34 million.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

Turned profitable in Q1:96; EPS to grow rapidly through 1998.</B>  Optika achieved profitability in Q1:96.  We estimate EPS of $0.10 in FY:96, $0.26 in FY:97, and $0.45 in FY:98.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>

Attractive valuation.</B>  With revenue currently growing better than 55%, long-term estimated revenue growth of 40%, and EPS estimated to grow at a faster rate, we believe a target multiple of 35x our 1997 estimate of $0.26 or 20x our 1998 EPS estimate of $0.45 is appropriate.  Therefore, we are initiating coverage with a STRONG BUY (1) rating and a price target of $9, a 50% increase over today's price.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B><P>

OrthoLogic Corp has been demonstrating better-than-expected sales and earnings growth as its flagship product, the OL1000, continues to expand the market for bone growth stimulation and takes share away from its competitors. We expect these trends in the core business to continue, and accordingly have raised our sales and earnings projections. The cash raised in the recent follow-on offering will strengthen OrthoLogic's position in the orthopaedics industry, primarily by allowing the company to expand its direct salesforce and to acquire additional high-margin product lines. We continue to rate OrthoLogic a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> and we are setting a 12-month price target on the stock of $44.50. 
<P>
<B><I>Overview</I></B>
<P>
We initiated coverage of OrthoLogic Corp with a STRONG BUY (1) recommendation on October 27, 1995, when the stock was trading at $9.38 per share. Today, with the stock up more than 270% to $34.88, we are reiterating that <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> rating.
<P>
Since our initial recommendation, the company not only turned the corner into profitability in the December 1995 quarter but has greatly exceeded our sales and earnings expectations in both the December 1995 and March 1996 quarters. Quite simply, the bone growth stimulation market and OrthoLogic's ability to penetrate that market have been far more robust than we originally anticipated. We expect these trends to continue.
<P>
Furthermore, the expected net proceeds of $74 million from the just-completed follow-on offering of 2.5 million shares increases OrthoLogic's cash position to more than $90 million. This gives the company tremendous potential to expand its product offerings, the intensity of its sales effort, and its level of profitability. Note that the offering is accretive to earnings, since the effect of the larger number of shares is more than offset by the higher level of interest income.
<P>
We expect OrthoLogic to use its cash to make an acquisition or acquisitions that will give it a significantly expanded direct salesforce and that will add products that complement its existing franchise in the bone growth stimulation and fracture fixation segments of the orthopaedics market. The decision to adopt a direct salesforce is especially significant. Greater focus equals better results: Note that during the March quarter the company's 12 direct sales representatives were responsible for 20% of the total sales; it took nearly 200 independent sales representatives to deliver the remaining 80% of sales. Overall, we think OrthoLogic is positioning itself to be a much larger and more effective manufacturer and marketer of orthopaedic tissue repair products. The goal is to be a consolidator of promising products in the fracture repair/trauma management niche of the industry.
<P>
With this report, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the company. The changes in our model do not reflect any contribution from the anticipated acquisitions. Rather, the changes in the model simply reflect revised assumptions about the growth trend for the OL1000, the increased share count, and the accretive impact of the higher level of interest income. 

<P>
<B><I>Key Investment Points</I></B><P>
<UL><LI><B>
Urgent medical need.</B>  Nonhealing fractures (broken bones that have not healed with conventional therapies) are very costly and very debilitating.  These fractures often require at least one surgery, which can cost between $7,500 and $20,000, and extended physical therapy.  Some never heal properly, even after multiple surgeries, leading to lifelong pain and loss of mobility.  Particularly severe cases might require amputation.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Big market.</B> There are more than six million fresh fractures in the U.S. each year.  The vast majority of these, perhaps 95-97%, heal just fine using conventional methods.  But the remaining 3-5%, or 180,000 to 300,000, are nonhealing.  This patient population represents an annual potential market of $500 million to $900 million in the U.S. alone (assuming the current average selling price per unit of $3,000).  So far, the practice of electrostimulation has not taken root overseas - but this could represent a fairly sizeable market three to five years from now.  

</UL>
<UL><LI><B>Proven efficacy.</B> Electrostimulation - the noninvasive, external application of an electrical current at the site of a bone fracture - is an effective form of treatment for nonhealing fractures. Follow-up data on the first 344 patients who have been treated with the OL1000 since it was launched in March 1994 show that use of the device was associated with a 78% overall fracture healing rate and an 81% healing rate in tibial fractures.  
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Differentiated technology/superior performance.</B>  The OL1000 uses a patented, proprietary combination of static and alternating magnetic fields.  This combined magnetic field helps to jump-start the body's natural bone healing process by stimulating the secretion of a potent bone cell growth factor, insulin-like growth factor II, or IGF-II. The OL1000 stimulates this cell-mediated healing process with just 30 minutes of use each day.  By contrast, all competing electrostimulation technologies that have been approved for use with nonhealing fractures use a single (alternating) magnetic field and require several hours of use each day.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Patient preference.</B>  The success of electrostimulation is dependent on patient compliance with the prescribed use regimen.  The easier it is for patients to use the device, the more likely they are to use it properly and the more likely they are to be healed.  We think patients will choose the OL1000's 30-minute-per-day regimen over the minimum 10-hour-a-day regimen with market-leader Biomet's system, the minimum three-hour requirement with AME's product, or the 24-hour-per-day operation of the Biolectron system.
</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Growing acceptance among physicians.</B>  An increasing number of orthopaedic surgeons and podiatrists are adopting or increasing the use of electrostimulation devices because they now have a scientific explanation of how these devices work at the cellular level and because the clinical data clearly support the use of these products.  The OL1000's 30-minute treatment time has also given physicians greater confidence that patients will use the product as directed and thus achieve better outcomes.  Previously, the poor patient outcomes - driven mostly by poor compliance - had made many physicians skeptical.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Appeal to managed care.</B>  The OL1000 appears to have been tailor-made for the demands of the managed care environment.  Given the solid efficacy data on the product, a growing number of carriers are willing to pay the up-front cost of electrostimulation therapy in an effort to avoid far more expensive surgeries and the costs associated with long-term care of nonhealing fractures.  OrthoLogic has launched an all-out campaign to educate payors about the benefits of bone growth stimulation.  This program directly targets the nurse/case managers, who are the front-line decision makers on product utilization and cost-containment within managed care programs.</UL>

<P><BR>

PAR is a 28-year old high technology engine. It researches and delivers advanced technology product for the U.S. government, and has successfully parlayed its knowledge to build a much larger business serving several large and growing commercial markets.  As a result, PAR has become the premier supplier of Integrated Transaction Information Processing (ITIP) computer terminals, systems and services to the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry. An extension of this technology to the factory floor has placed PAR in the market for manufacturing and warehousing data collection and transaction processing.
<P>
We expect earnings per share, which have grown at 25% over recent years, to accelerate to a 30-35% growth rate over the next 2-3 year period, driven by (i) increased market share in PAR's base business, (ii) operating leverage, and (iii) the emergence of new technology-based commercial businesses.  The most interesting of these is PAR Vision Systems, which has a Corneal Topography System (CTS) used in conjunction with laser eye surgery.  Our one-year price target for PAR stock is $25, 18.5x our $1.35 EPS projection for 1998, and our rating is BUY (2).
<P><BR>

<B><I>Summary </I></B>
<UL><LI>
<B>EPS Growth to Accelerate as Emerging Businesses Generate Profits.</B> PAR, which came public in the early 1980s, recently reported its thirteenth consecutive profitable quarter and is now, we believe, poised for accelerating EPS growth.  This will occur as a significant new QSR customer, Burger King, starts to receive product, as PAR enters the full service restaurant (FSR) business, and as the industrial ITIP and CTS businesses begin to generate significant profits. In 1995, PAR spent approximately $2 million in development expenses while generating only nominal revenues in nascent commercial businesses.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Large Market Opportunities for Emerging Businesses.</B>  The market for PAR's factory/warehouse ITIP product was about $1.4 billion in 1995, growing at 17%.  With 1995 revenues of less than $6 million in this area, and key customers such as Goodyear, Whirlpool and Rhone-Poulenc, PAR has a major opportunity to grow.  Its product offering is particularly suited to larger users with complex, multiple data systems in place.  The CTS product addresses an exciting new medical device market now that excimer laser photorefractive keratotomy (PRK) has been approved for vision correction in the U.S.; this market also appears to have potential in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Stable, Growing Market for Base Business.</B> Underpinning a stable platform to support the growth of its new businesses, the Company's primary commercial market - QSR products, systems and services - is growing at about 10% per year. PAR's main QSR customers are McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and now Burger King; PAR has the leading worldwide market share in this market.  Driving factors for growth include (a) replacement of older technology systems with higher functionality products, providing order processing, inventory control, and sales reporting functions; (b) new applications, e.g., RF (portable) terminals for facilitating drive-through ordering; (c) new, nontraditional QSR locations, such as in-store facilities in Sam's Clubs and institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and airports); (d) international growth, particularly with McDonald's and KFC.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Base Business Revenues and Profits Growing Faster than Market.</B> Based on PAR's POS III open system, QSR revenues and profit contribution should grow significantly faster than the market as PAR takes share from less able transaction processing competitors and operating margins widen. Revenues should grow at 25%, earnings contribution at over 35-40%.  PAR is penetrating its existing accounts more deeply, with a multi-year contract at Taco Bell covering service and support for Taco Bell's whole network being a prototype for other potential relationships.  PAR's new open system ITIP design allows it to support a wide range of software applications and will enable the Company to begin penetrating the full service restaurant (FSR) and pizza market this year.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Government Business Continues to Provide Technology, Cash Flow. </B> In addition to its primary ITIP businesses, PAR generates 22% of its revenues from government contract R&D and other services work, which provides both a stable flow of cash and a continuing window on technologies with commercial exploitation potential.  PAR has made money on its government business every year since 1968.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Strong, Clean Balance Sheet, More Cash Coming.</B> The balance sheet is clean, with $15.7 million in cash (pro-forma for the July 11, 1996 offering), and although the Company has over $27 million in available bank credit lines, there is currently only nominal borrowing under these lines. PAR generated $2.3 million operating cash flow in the first six months of this year, and we project further cash generation for the balance of 1996.
</UL><UL><LI><B>
Stock Underfollowed, Underowned and Undervalued.</B> The stock is underfollowed, underowned institutionally (only a handful of institutional owners apart from index funds), and accordingly undervalued. Book value at June 30, 1996 pro-forma for the offering was $7.68 per share, and the shares sell at 12.5 times our 1997 EPS estimate of $1.05, well below our projected three-year EPS growth rate of 30-35%. Market capitalization is $114.7 million, less than one times our $121.1 million revenue estimate for 1996.
</UL><P></P>

<B><I>Company Background</I></B>

<P><BR>
PAR is a 28-year old high technology engine. It conducts research and delivers product in several advanced technology areas for the U.S. government, and has parlayed its knowledge and expertise in this set of technologies to build a much larger business serving several large and growing commercial markets.  As a result of its expertise in rugged environment, high-reliability data processing, PAR has become the premier supplier of Integrated Transaction Information Processing (ITIP) computer terminals, systems and services to the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry, with over 18,000 installations. An extension of ITIP to the factory floor has placed PAR in the much larger, and more rapidly growing market for manufacturing and warehousing data collection and transaction processing.
<P>
Another expertise area - image processing - has led to the development of a very accurate and easy to use system for measuring the topography of the cornea.  This Corneal Topography System (CTS) is used to prescribe laser surgery for vision defect correction, and to measure the results of surgery to verify its success. We anticipate that PAR will continue to develop these and other commercial applications for its technologies, which will be exploited either directly by the Company or in conjunction with others, in alliances or partnerships, or through acquisition.  The company recently completed an equity offering which raised approximately $13.4 million, primarily to support these developments.

<P>
Pediatric Services of America, Inc. is the largest company specializing in home care for pediatric patients, especially premature infants who often are the most medically complex and expensive in a given health plan. It should grow through an increased demand by managed care plans to get these sick children out of the hospital, and an increased willingness by doctors to send them home if high quality care is available.  It is the only pure play in the public stock market.  In addition, acquisitions could accelerate future growth.  With a long-term normalized net income growth rate of 25% and calendar 1996 earnings per share of $1.13, we have a twelve-month price target of $28.  Earnings per share growth is somewhat lower near-term because of the increase in share count from two recent stock offerings.  This represents potential price appreciation of 40% from the current stock price.  We rate the stock as <B>BUY (2)</B>.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Pediatric Services is unique in the public market in its focus on pediatric home care. </B> It is a pure play on a market growing faster than other home care sectors because payers want to get these expensive cases out of the hospital, while doctors are just beginning to feel comfortable with the care available at home.  We estimate that Pediatric Services' market share in its geographical regions is less than 5% of patients discharged from neonatal intensive care units.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Because the niche is so specific, Pediatric Services can subcontract the pediatric business from other home health companies with exclusive payer contracts.</B>  The trend in home health, as in all of health care, is for a handful of large companies to sign exclusive contracts with large regional and national health plans.  Pediatric Services can participate by handling the pediatric patients within these contracts;  it is large enough to be the ideal choice of the referring home care company.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company has a strong operating management. </B> Most of Pediatric Services' senior management was with the company prior to 1987, when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout from Charter Medical.  The group has managed the Company's debt, one large and several small acquisitions, and continued growth in its core business.  They have a demonstrated track record of skilled operations.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Pediatric Services has minimal Medicare exposure.</B>  Although the Company has Medicare patients, they represent only 18% of total revenue.  The focus on pediatric patients means that by definition, the Company is not heavily dependent upon the government's program for the elderly.  At the same time, Pediatric Services does have the same underlying positive fundamentals that make the home health industry so attractive, namely the trend toward getting patients out of the hospital sooner and treating them at home.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Long-term normalized growth is 25%. </B> Although current earnings per share growth is being hampered by the large number of shares from two recent offerings, once the Company navigates through this temporary trough, we think the growth rate will pick up significantly.  Net income is expected to  show 96.7% growth in 1995 and 41.1% in 1996.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Physician Support Systems, Inc. (PSS) is a leading provider of business management services to physicians - a $15.0 billion market growing at 20% per year as physicians come under increasing pressure to operate more efficiently.

The Company's core services, technologies, and strong competitive advantages should support growth of at least 40% annually for the next few years.  Our one-year price target is $31, and our rating is <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B>.
<P>
 
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<UL><LI> 
<B>Outsourcing of physician practice management services - a large and rapidly growing market.</B>  Several factors affecting physician practices - including increasingly complex reimbursement processes, downward pressure on medical fees, loss of clinical autonomy, pressures to affiliate, and increased data management requirements - are working together to increase demand for business management services.  We estimate that the accounts receivable management (ARM) segment alone accounted for $15.0 billion in physician expenditures in 1995, of which the 50 largest outsource companies accounted for less than $1.0 billion in fee revenue (less than 7.0% of the total amount spent).  
 

</UL><UL><LI>Concurrently, there is a movement among providers to increase their outsourcing of practice management services, while the ARM business providers are offering a broader range of strategic, administrative, information, and clinical services.  We estimate the total market for business management services for physicians to be a $64 billion market opportunity by the year 2000. Accordingly, substantial  growth opportunities exist for PSS.

</UL><UL><LI> 
<B>Market leadership.</B>  PSS currently provides desirable and established services and has a large client base of over 2,500 physician specialists.  These specialists earn the highest incomes, typically outsource ARM, and are increasingly forming specialty networks, group practices, and independent practice associations (IPAs) in response to managed care.  Its expansive client base positions PSS as one of the two largest companies (only Medaphis is larger) in the emerging physician practice services industry with (i) a national scope, (ii) a full range of  outsourcing services not otherwise available to the medical community on a cost-effective basis, and (iii) experience in most practice settings 3/4 including management of the oldest and largest IPA in the country with over 340 physicians.

</UL><UL><LI><B>Solid fundamentals.</B>   PSS has a demonstrated ability to grow both internally and by acquisition.  The Company has substantially improved existing operations through implementation of centralized processing centers and other methodologies.  In addition, PSS has developed proprietary software systems, patient encounter databases, statistical reporting systems, and other information management technologies (including electronic data interchange, or EDI) that contribute to outstanding operating performance, as evidenced by high EBITDA margins, revenue per full-time employee (FTE), and client retention rates.  As a result, PSS is among the most cost-efficient providers of business management services in the industry and has the highest client retention rates.
 
</UL><UL><LI><B>Numerous future opportunities.</B>  PSS's excellent client reputation, large existing base of  over 2,500 physician clients, and expertise in IPA and management services organizations (MSOs) provide tremendous opportunity to (i) expand into new services increasingly in demand with the growth of managed care, (ii) cross-sell additional services in its existing specialty areas, and (iii) consolidate the more than 1,200 small business services and ARM companies that are increasingly constrained by their limited information systems, management, and access to capital.   </UL>

<BR><P>
Planning Sciences is an emerging leader in enterprise decision support software (EDSS) applications.  The Company's complete application development and delivery system is unmatched by any of its competitors.  In 1996, Planning Sciences should achieve revenue growth of 50% and EPS growth of 89%.
<BR><P> 
Despite strong fundamentals and a positive outlook for the industry, investor enthusiasm for data-warehousing-related stocks has somewhat waned recently due to a reduction in valuations for high-growth companies.  Due to recent weakness in the stock, we raised our rating to <B>BUY (2)</B> from Neutral (3) on June 26, 1996.  Planning Sciences is currently trading at a multiple of 61.4 times our FY:97 EPS estimate; our 12-month price target is $29.95.
<BR><P>

<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI><B>
An Emerging Leader in Enterprise Decision Support Software Applications.</B>  The Company's complete application development and delivery system incorporates state-of-the-art technology.  Specifically, Planning Sciences has leveraged distributed object-oriented architecture, multidimensional databases, and on-line analytical processing (OLAP).</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>
Competitive Edge.</B>  The Company successfully competes against at least five decision-support vendors who have larger revenue and customer bases.  Gentia, Planning Sciences' flagship product, is a client/server development environment support by distributed object-oriented technology and an advanced multidimensional database.  The strength and flexibility of Gentia is manifest in Planning Sciences' ability to rapidly prototype useful applications for prospective clients.  These prototypes are not merely skeletal solutions to a client's analysis problems, but encompass impressive functionality and can be deployed throughout an enterprise.  The fact that the Company beats out its competitors at least 75% of the time when clients request detailed product evaluations is evidence of Gentia's superiority.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>
Traditional Vendors Poorly Positioned for the Future.</B> Many traditional decision-support vendors have either aging technology and/or weakened competitive positions.  Consequently, we expect Planning Sciences to grow substantially faster than the overall market.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>
Strong Acceptance by User Community.</B>  The current era is a propitious one for Planning Sciences: High-power graphical desktops and servers coupled with an established networking infrastructure have made enterprisewide decision support feasible.  In addition, the success of Arbor Software has made multidimensional OLAP database technology well accepted by organizations.  The large current market will allow the Company's Gentia system to gain market share.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>
Expanding Distribution.</B> We expect significant growth in the U.S., which is currently underpenetrated.  The worldwide sales pipeline is up approximately 75-100% from one year ago.  Given current growth, we are confident the Company can execute its growth plan of expanded direct sales in the U.S. and distribution in continental Europe.</UL>

<P></P>

SoftQuad International is a leading provider of multiplatform,
standards-based software tools for authoring and publishing digital content. 
SoftQuad's powerful, easy-to-use software and multitiered distribution position
the Company to take advantage of the explosive projected growth in Internet and
corporate intranet publishing, producing rapid projected revenue growth of 121%
and 79% in fiscal 1996 and 1997, respectively.  Accordingly, we are initiating
coverage of SoftQuad with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendation and a price target of
$12. 
<P><BR>
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<BR><P>

<UL><LI><B>
Author once, publish anywhere.</B> SoftQuad develops, markets, and
supports digital content authoring tools that enable nontechnical and technical
users to create and distribute standards-based, formatted digital content
independent of output medium, whether via paper, CD-ROM, computer screen, or the
Internet, the World Wide Web and corporate intranets.   The Company's suite of
products allows users to create and publish vast amounts of various types of
digital content, including text, hypertext, graphics, audio, video, and 3-D
images, which adhere to the open, international publishing standard SGML, and
its subset HTML, which is currently the de facto standard for Web publishing. 
Using these publishing standards, organizations and individuals are able to
create and organize digital content that can be broadly accessed, independent of
output medium. </LI></UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Explosive growth in Internet and intranet publishing.</B> The number of Web
servers installed worldwide is expected to grow 15-fold by 1998 as corporations
roll out Internet and corporate intranet applications for internal and external
communication and collaboration.  The market for tools to author content to be
distributed by these servers is expected to grow from approximately $15 million
in 1995 to $300 million in 1998. </LI></UL>

<UL><LI><B>Award-winning HTML authoring tools.</B> HTML is currently the
standard language for publishing content on the World Wide Web.  SoftQuad's HTML
product, HoTMetaL, has earned numerous awards for its high performance,
flexibility, and ease-of-use in creating hypertext and multimedia-capable Web
pages.  </LI></UL> 

<UL><LI><B>Leading supplier of SGML technology.</B> SGML (standard
generalized markup language) is an open international standard allowing
perpetual reuse of information.  Content digitally encoded in SGML can be
published independent of output medium, including paper, CD-ROM, computer
screen, or the Internet and corporate intranet.  HTML (the language used to
publish content on the World Wide Web) is a limited use of SGML.  </LI></UL>

<UL><LI><B>Broad product line.</B> SoftQuad offers an array of multiplatform,
standards-based software tools for publishing and viewing HTML and SGML content.
 Products range from the $195 HoTMetaL PRO 2.0 for individual Web page
developers to the $10,000-plus Sculptor and Explorer for large-scale corporate
SGML intranet deployments.  By supplying freeware, &quot;light&quot;, and &quot;pro&quot;
versions of its products, the Company encourages trade-ups to more powerful and
fully featured versions of its products over time. 
</LI></UL> 

<UL><LI><B>Multitiered distribution strategy.</B> SoftQuad seeks to reach the
largest possible audience for its products through multiple distribution
channels.  The Company distributes its products worldwide via its Web site,
retail stores (through distributors Ingram Micro, Merisel, Tech Data, and
Computer 2000), and, for high-end SGML products, a direct salesforce.  In
addition, to broadly penetrate the rapidly growing corporate intranet market,
the Company has established numerous OEM relationships with leading hardware and
software vendors, including Verity, Open Text, Spry, Xerox, and Dell Computer,
and value-added reseller arrangements with 27 VARs in 17 countries. </LI></UL>

<UL><LI><B> Experienced management team.</B> David Gurney, SoftQuad's
president and CEO, was a cofounder of Delrina Corporation, a Canadian software
development company recently acquired by Symantec.  Mr. Gurney has assembled an
experienced management team, including ex-Delrina executives Mike Cooperman
(chief operating officer), Larry Levy (vice president, Europe), Roberto
Drassinower (vice president, professional and consulting services), and Linda
Hazzen (director of marketing).

With record backlog, 20%-plus growth from its core laboratory information systems business, a $3 billion cross-selling opportunity from its installed base of over 600 healthcare organizations, and a host of new products that address the emerging computer-based patient record (CPR) and managed care information systems markets, we expect strong growth in the Company's earnings.  We rate the stock <B>STRONG BUY(1)</B> and our one-year price target is $25.
<P>

<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI><B>Sunquest Has the Platform and the Products.</B>  The healthcare industry's appetite for clinical information systems is borne out by the recent 1996 Healthcare Information Management System Society (HIMSS) Leadership Survey, representing the opinions of 1,200 decision makers.  The most revealing aspects of the survey related to providers' application priorities, which included clinical data repositories (27%), new clinical systems such as lab and radiology (19%), and computer-based patient record systems (CPR) (18%).  
 <P>
 As one of the largest companies providing laboratory information systems (LISs), clinical data repositories, and CPR systems to large, multi-entity healthcare organizations and integrated delivery networks (IDN), Sunquest should be a major beneficiary of these purchasing trends.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>The Lab Market Is Robust for Sunquest.</B>  In 1995, the Company added 77 new lab clients (from 30 new contracts). Furthermore, Sunquest has enhanced its products to address the multihospital and commercial lab markets, and has been successful in expanding into the relatively unpenetrated international market. The Company's average request for proposal (RFP) has increased to an average of four hospitals per installation, providing further support for our view that the high end of the market is increasingly driving technology purchasing decisions. With a strong laboratory product line, established relationships, and exceptionally high client satisfaction rates of greater than 90%, we expect Sunquest to enhance its position as the laboratory systems vendor of choice for the integrated delivery network market and continue to grow its core LIS business over 20% per year.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Technology and Service Leadership.</B> Sunquest has competed very successfully in complex computing environments.  Sunquest has made significant investments in its business and technical infrastructure, client services organization, and strategic services necessary to support large IDNs in their enterprisewide, patient-centered information technology (IT) initiatives.  
<P>
The Company's state-of-the-art clinical repository and clinical workstation products enable clients to pursue an open systems, client/server architecture. Also, the Company's extensive experience with interfacing and integrating complex clinical information systems in large hospitals and IDNs, and unprecedented reputation for the highest levels of customer support provide a stronghold with clients - making Sunquest its clients' strategic supplier of clinical IT solutions. 
 
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Excellent Fundamentals.</B> We consider the following competitive advantages to be instrumental to Sunquest's future success: (i) size and quality of installed base, (ii) quality and breadth of product line, (iii) open systems and client/server architecture, (iv) commitment to research and development, (v) customer services and satisfaction, and (vi) comprehensive integration and networking services. Sunquest scores highly in all of these areas. 

<P>Additionally, the Company has a long history of profitability; has exhibited strong growth in new systems; has a record backlog of about $72 million; and an excellent client reputation as reflected by its large reference base of blue chip organizations (e.g., the Mayo Clinic, Kaiser, UCSF, FHP, Scripps, and Intermountain), and alliances with third-party vendors (e.g., IDX, IBM, PACE) and multi-entity group purchasing organizations (e.g., Sutter, Catholic Healthcare West).  These advantages, coupled with recent initiatives to bolster the Company's product line and enhance sales and marketing should lead to a strong financial performance.

<H1>THE BUDGET PROCESS</H1>
                                
<p>Each individual department of the city of Mesa annually submits a budget, or listing of its estimated costs for operating for the next year, to the Budget and Research Office. The Budget and Research staff then adds up all expected expenditures from all departments and compares that figure to all the anticipated revenues for the upcoming year. 

<p>The staff works with the individual departments, then later with the Mayor, City Council and City Manager, to make sure the total amount of money, or budget requested, is the same or less than the total amount of money that the City expects to make the following year.

<P></P>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>We believe that Tekelec shares represent a highly attractive investment play on the deployment of advanced telecommunications technologies. The Company's expertise is increasingly valuable to network operators and manufacturers working to introduce AIN, broadband, and digital wireless services and equipment. Over the next several years, we expect Tekelec will achieve earnings growth in excess of 30% as a result of enhanced distribution, new products and increasing acceptance of its EAGLE STP by major telephone companies. Our target range of $26-$28 represents appreciation potential of 30-40% from current levels. <P>

<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Tekelec's key competitive strength is its expertise with a wide variety of communications protocols.</B> The Company has developed software-oriented diagnostic and switching products that target emerging, high-growth communications market segments such as AIN, digital wireless and broadband networks.  </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Tekelec's EAGLE STP is the industry's most technologically advanced SS7 switch.</B> The system offers significant advantages in performance, scalability, reliability, ease of management and cost of ownership. SS7 technology enables the delivery of AIN services such as caller ID, voice processing, custom routing and billing and personal number services. Sales of the EAGLE switch were nearly $17 million in 1994, more than double the previous year's level. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The proliferation of new communications standards and protocols is driving demand for a new generation of diagnostic equipment.</B> Tekelec supplies integrated diagnostic systems that support emerging network standards such as ATM, frame relay, ISDN and SS7. The Company's systems are highly flexible and can be configured for applications ranging from product development to network operations. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company is positioned to increase its AIN market penetration through strategic relationships.</B> Tekelec has formed a relationship with AT&T to distribute the EAGLE STP. AT&T should be particularly helpful increasing penetration of RBOC and international accounts, which has been minimal to date. The Company also has a marketing agreement with Stratus Computer, which offers an SCP for AIN applications. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Tekelec should generate expanding operating profit margins in coming periods.</B> Gross profit margins average around 65%, reflecting the high software content in the Company' products. As sales expand, Tekelec should be able to leverage its operating expenses and deliver expanding operating and net margins. </UL>

<H1>FINAL STAGES</H1>
                                
Because all Mesa citizens contribute to the revenues of the City, through paying of fees, and taxes, public hearings on the proposed budget for the next year are held and citizens may speak in favor of or against items in the proposed budget. 

Like a family, the City tries to spend less than it makes in order to save some money for the next year or for "a rainy day." The entire budgeting process takes about six months.

<I><B>Introduction</B></I>
<BR><P>
In the three years since Volpe, Welty & Company published its first Internet industry report ("Life On The Net," September 1992), most of Wall Street has climbed on the bandwagon.  The purpose of this report is to refine the widely hyped Internet investment opportunity by identifying the most promising near- and medium-term investment segments within the Internet arena. <BR><P>

<I><B>What's So Great About the Internet Anyway?</B></I>
<BR><P>
Contrary to what some Internet company valuations might suggest at present, the Internet will not cure cancer, ensure world peace or make you thinner.  <I>Why, then all the excitement?</I>  It is our long-held view that the Internet will alter, perhaps obliterate, time-worn models of interaction and transaction among individuals and enterprises.  The upheaval ushered in by the Internet has triggered extraordinary investment opportunities; we offer the following guidelines to help strucutre an Internet investment strategy.<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Commerce</B>, in its many forms, will be the major driver of Internet growth.<BR>
</UL><BR><UL><LI>Over the next two years, the most plentiful opportunities for investors will be in the areas of enabling tools and business applications.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>Enabling tools - including software tools for the creation, management and protection of content - represent the fundamental building blocks for deployment of the Internet.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>Business applications on the Internet and Intranet will enjoy accelerating growth in the next 12 months, as all the tools necessary for massive deployment are falling into place.
</UL><BR><UL><LI> In the content area, companies that build leading brand names will enjoy extraordinary profits.  With a few notable exceptions, however, content businesses (particularly high-bandwidth entertainment applications addressing the consumer market) will emerge more slowly than tools.  The methodologies for building and <I>measuring</I> the economic value of content on the Internet, for both the consumer and the provider, are still emerging.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>Because the Internet is a powerful direct-to-customer selling tool, agents, aggregators, and specialists will be able to build superb information-based businesses that are low in cost but global in touch.
</UL><BR><UL><LI>Consumers are unlikely to embrace the Internet <I>en masse</I> until the end of the decade, when bandwidth is abundant and cheap, and when the Internet is as acccessible and easy to use as a television or telephone.

<p>The City of Mesa "earns" its money, or generates revenues, through a variety of sources.  

<p>The largest source of revenue is the sale of utility services. The City collects fees for
providing natural gas, water, sewer, electricity, solid waste (refuse, recycling and brush collection)
and irrigation services.

<p>Other revenues come from state grants, shared taxes, a one-percent City sales tax, various
development taxes and fees, and federal funds.

<p>Unlike most other cities in Arizona and the nation as a whole, the City of Mesa does not
charge property taxes.

<p>Mesa budget planners predict the City will take in $395 million in revenues for 1996-97. For
more information, call (602) 644-2327.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P><BR>
ULTRADATA Corporation is a leading supplier of on-line information processing systems for mid- to larger-sized credit unions.  By capitalizing on client/server technology, the Company has  successfully captured market share.  Because credit unions continue to seek out ways to offer increasingly complex financial services, we expect increasing demand for ULTRADATA's products. Therefore, we expect ULTRADATA to grow revenue and EPS at 30% for the next several years.  We rate the stock a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> with a one-year price target of $18.50, based on a P/E multiple of 23.1x (comparable to the group multiple of 23.3) our estimated 1997 EPS of $0.80.
<P><BR>
<B><I>Summary </B></I>
<P><BR>
<UL><LI>
Providing on-line systems to credit unions ULTRADATA offers a wide range of on-line systems to the credit union industry.  The Company's core ULTRAFIS system supports the complete operation of a credit union,  including the checking and savings, ATM, credit and debit card, and investment account operations.  We believe the Company's recent accelerated growth is due to the high functionality of its core systems and products.
</UL><UL><LI>
Increasing its win rate and pipeline Over the past two years, ULTRADATA has experienced a significant increase in market share on new deals in the mid to high end of the market - its primary areas of focus.  During 1995, ULTRADATA's win rate, based on contract value, increased to over 50% compared to 40% in 1994. In addition, the Company has experienced a 52% expansion of its new deal pipeline over the past year, as credit unions are now actively looking to replace their older-generation systems with new software, which can handle the more fluid financial services market of the 1990s. 
</UL><UL><LI>
Consolidating industry is a positive for ULTRADATA The total number of credit unions declined between 1993 and 1995 from 12,960 to 12,283; however, the number of credit unions in ULTRADATA's target market increased from 1,131 to 1,234 over the same time period.  These larger credit unions need more advanced solutions to their technology problems. ULTRADATA's  ULTRAFIS and its companion products provide these solutions.
</UL><UL><LI>
Opportunities outside its credit union customers ULTRADATA has developed its new products to operate with other core financial transaction systems.  This capability will enable the Company to sell its new products to other financial institutions and credit unions with non-ULTRADATA-based processing systems. ULTRADATA has been actively marketing its loan processing product, ALPS, outside its customer base, uncovering revenue potential of $5-10 million and has signed up a reseller, MDS Decisions Systems Inc., to target the banking market.
</UL><UL><LI>
Substantial revenue and earnings visibility Because of the surge in 1995 business, ULTRADATA has unusual visibility into revenue and earnings for 1996. The Company's current backlog should ensure that the Company meets our 1H:96 estimates.  Visibility on Q3:96 revenue is also very high with 70% of revenue either in-hand or highly predictable.
</UL><UL><LI>
Strong revenue and EPS growth We think ULTRADATA can grow revenue and EPS at 30% over the next several years.  Margins should expand to the 15%-plus range as software license revenue becomes a larger component of revenue.  This trend is based upon the increased number of new high-software-content client/server applications, which can be sold to existing customers as well as to new prospects who do not have an investment in the core ULTRAFIS system.
</UL><UL><LI>
12-month price target of $18.50. At current prices, ULTRADATA stock is selling at a P/E multiple of 16.3 times our 1996 EPS estimate of $0.60.  This contrasts with a comparable company group average of 23.3x 1996 consensus estimates.  We think our 12-month price target of $18.50, (23.1x our 1997 EPS estimate of $0.80) makes ULTRADATA stock an attractive investment opportunity.</UL>

<H1>Expenditures</H1>
                                
The City of Mesa's expenditures, or the money it spends, are used to provide a variety of services to its 342,000 residents.

The City pays for or funds departments such as police and fire, which includes paying the salaries of the people who work in these departments, their equipment and vehicles, telephone systems, and computers, that in turn aid and protect Mesa citizens.

The cost of constructing, maintaining and expanding streets and utility services, and the workers involved, is included in the City's expenditures.

The City also provides and must pay for recreational facilities, such as public pools, golf courses and parks, along with special programs, events and recreational activities, and the people who maintain and coordinate them.

When figuring expenses, the costs for operating and maintaining the Mesa Community and Conference Center, the Mesa Public Library system, Falcon Field municipal airport, the Mesa Dial-A-Ride and Valley Metro transit programs, and the Mesa Cemetery must be included.

After subtracting its projected expenditures from the revenues it expects, the City of Mesa is well under the state-imposed expenditure limit by approximately $8 million for the 1996-97 budget.

Mesa's budget for 1996-97 is $395 million in expenditures. For more information, call (602) 644-2327.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
United Dental Care, Inc. markets and manages prepaid dental plans to employee groups.  A leader in the dental care market, the Company is growing as demand for less-expensive employee benefits increases and as patients and employers demand more predictable medical costs.  We are looking for fully diluted earnings per share of $0.68 for 1995 versus $0.44 for 1994, $0.94 for 1996, and $1.23 for 1997.  With a long-term growth rate of 30%, we have a 12-month price target of $37. Given the long-term potential for strong growth and the likelihood of acceleration from acquisition, we recommend that investors watch the stock and buy on weakness. We are initiating coverage of United Dental Care with a <B>BUY (2)</B> rating.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>United Dental is a leader in the managed dental care market.</B> United Dental has about 970,000 members, including the U.S. Dental Management acquisition, and is one of the largest independent managed dental care companies. Its size gives United Dental credibility in entering new markets, negotiating strength with dentists, and visibility for making acquisitions.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>United Dental Care is a successful market consolidator.</B> The Company completed one 400,000-life acquisition in 1994 and another 200,000-life  in 1995.  The growing market continues to consolidate because most dental plans have under 300,000 members.  Many of the small plans are strong in one city or have a few strong employer contracts.  By acquiring these smaller plans, larger plans, such as United Dental, can enter new markets inexpensively while saving money on overhead.  Potential acquisitions for United Dental are not in our earnings estimates, as their large size makes the timing difficult to predict.  However, the Company can afford to and intends to make acquisitions, probably at the rate of one every nine to 12 months.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Prepaid dental plans are popular with employees and employers. </B>  Managed dental plans offer employees a low-cost way to pay for their dental care.  Industry premiums average $27.13 per month for family and  $10.65 for individual coverage, according to the National Association of Dental Plans.  Employers can enhance their employee benefits at a lower cost than a dental indemnity program.  This cost difference is driving market demand, where dental coverage is a new benefits feature.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Managed care is a small but rapidly growing sector of the dental benefits business. </B> According to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, 62% of all employees in 1993 had dental insurance;  according to the National Association of Dental Plans, only 17% of employers offer a managed dental plan option.  This means there is a large pool of people with no dental insurance, let alone those in unmanaged programs.  However, enrollment in managed plans has grown dramatically; increasing 27% in 1994 from 1993.</UL>

<title>Welcome to Mesa</title>

</head>


<H1>Welcome to Mesa</H1><p>Mesa is one of the nation's fastest growing communities, with a
population that grew by 89 percent in the past decade. There are solid reasons for Mesa's growth:
low costs of doing business;  a reasonable tax structure; a skilled and well-educated workforce;
low crime rate; superior schools;  affordable housing; excellent quality of life; and an abundant
water supply. <p>Founded in 1878 and incorporated in 1883, Mesa is the Spanish word for "table
top," describing a flat-topped, raised area. The first settlers built homes on a mesa above the
surrounding area.<p>From that small settlement of farm families, Mesa has grown to become
Arizona's third largest and the nation's 53rd largest city with a population of 340,000. Mesa is 15
miles east of Phoenix and covers more than 120 square miles. The City offers advantages of a
suburban environment and a thriving metropolis, yet maintains the warmth and charm of a small
town.<p>Many City offices are housed in the Mesa City Plaza Building, 20 E. Main St., and the
Municipal Building, 55 N. Center St., such as: Building, Utility and Zoning information; City
Clerk; Tax and Licensing; and Utilities Customer Service. For general information, call
644-2011.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>

We believe that UroCor, Inc. is one of the most highly evolved and successful companies in the emerging field of disease management. The Company's chosen specialty is urology, to which it is bringing a unique combination of diagnostic services, therapeutics, information services, and practice management capabilities. With market penetration approaching 20% and no comparably integrated competition visible, UroCor has achieved early leadership in this area.
<P>
We anticipate sustainable revenue growth of at least 35% over the next three to five years, along with substantial operating margin improvement in both 1996 and 1997. Our 12-month price target of $19 is based on a multiple of 40x forward EPS, and we rate the shares <B>BUY (2)</B>.
<P>

<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI><B>Pure Play in Urology Disease Management.</B> UroCor offers a unique combination of diagnostic services, therapeutics, information services, and practice management capabilities, focused solely on urology. These resources enable urologists to make more informed decisions concerning major urological diseases.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Targeting a Major Market Opportunity.</B> UroCor's potential customer base is represented by the 7,500 office-based urologists practicing in the United States. The average urologist directs nearly $100,000 per year in expenditures for diagnostic testing services. Clinical testing for bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and kidney stones alone approximated $400 million in spending last year. The therapeutic products segment of urology, which UroCor expects to enter within the next 12 months, exceeds $2.0 billion in annual expenditures.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Urology Is Ideal for Disease Management.</B> By functioning as diagnostician, surgeon, and oncologist, the urologist is positioned to fulfill patient care needs throughout an entire disease cycle. For prostate or bladder cancer, this disease cycle can range from three to ten years. The unique role of the urologist makes this specialty an ideal proving ground for the concept of disease management.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>UroDiagnostics.</B> A Foundation for Integrated Disease Management: UroCor has established a major foothold in the offices of almost 1,500 urologists by offering clinical lab testing services through its UroDiagnostics Group. UroDiagnostics provides comprehensive and proprietary services that i) detect major urological diseases; ii) offer a prognosis of the patient's condition; iii) monitor the course of therapy; and, iv) screen for disease recurrence.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>UroTherapeutics</B> Entry into Pharmaceutical Marketing: UroCor will capitalize on the strength of its existing specialized salesforce by licensing or comarketing urological pharmaceuticals. The Company's first product should be Pacis, a therapy for bladder cancer, for which UroCor obtained exclusive U.S. marketing rights from BioChem Pharma, Ltd.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Experienced and Capable Management Team</B> UroCor's senior managers can boast of long stints at major diagnostics and medical products companies, including Baxter-Travenol, Becton Dickinson & Co., MetPath, American Hospital Supply, and Dianon. Most of the Company's senior executives have held their current positions for more than four years, during which time they formulated the Company's overall strategy and launched the UroDiagnostics business.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Potential for Increased Operating Leverage.</B> UroCor's current marketing infrastructure is capable of serving a large portion of the urology market. We anticipate significant economies of scale over the next few years, based on increased penetration of the urologist market and new product introductions. An improvement in profit margins is expected to contribute significantly to estimated EPS growth in 1996 and 1997.</UL>

<BR><P>
US Robotics with its strong communications software skills, broad distribution channels, proven management, and a widely recognized brand name, is one of the world's premier suppliers of information access products to consumers, corporations, and Internet service providers. While the Company has experienced strong growth over the last few years, we think that the emerging trend by consumers and corporations to connect to the Internet, intranets, and wireless networks provides investors with even more spectacular opportunities. We also think that the Company will be a major winner in the emerging market for computer-telephony equipment.
<P>
We expect these trends to result in strong revenue and earnings growth and think that the stock could conservatively trade at 33 times our CY:97 EPS estimate of $3.72.  This suggests a 12-month price target of $122, a 25% appreciation from today's price. Therefore, we are initiating coverage with a <STRONG>BUY(2)</STRONG> rating.
<BR><P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The worldwide market for information access products is poised for explosive growth.</B> Demand for information access products is driven by the growing trend by consumers and corporations to connect to the Internet and intranets, and by the desire to have ubiquitous and inexpensive access to information. Only those product vendors with innovative technologies, strong brand names, and access to key distribution channels are likely to succeed. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>US Robotics is the leader in information access products and technologies.</B> US Robotics is more than just an analog-modem company. With its strong communications software skills, broad distribution channels, proven management, and a widely recognized brand name, US Robotics is one of the world's premier suppliers of information access products to consumers, corporations, Internet service providers, and wireless network operators. It is the undisputed market leader in analog modems and remote access servers and hubs.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company's digital signal processing (DSP) skills and knowledge of telephony and data communications are a major competitive advantage.</B> This expertise, combined with flexible product architectures, enable the Company to rapidly enhance the features of existing products and exploit new market opportunities. We expect US Robotics to use its skill to become one of the leading networking companies and a major player in the markets for ISDN, cable and asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) modems, as well as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) products, wireless data infrastructures and computer-telephony technologies.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
V-ONE's products provide comprehensive network security and enable secure electronic commerce applications over TCP/IP networks.  Organizations are increasingly cognizant of the need for robust security as the Internet and intranets reshape corporation information infrastructures.  Through V-ONE's systems approach - combining authentication, access control, and encryption in a tightly integrated package - the Company has established itself as a leader in security for these fast-growing networks.<P>
<B><I>Investment Highlights</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The network security sector is a direct investment play on the growth of TCP/IP networks, including the Internet and intranets.</B> We forecast that the market for network security products will grow at a 68% compound annual rate from $500 million in 1995 to $6.8 billion in 2000.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>V-ONE provides a highly differentiated security solution</B> in a market characterized by point products in three functional areas: authentication (passwords and tokens), network access control (firewalls), and data protection (encryption).  V-ONE's product offerings meet the demands of the next growth wave for the network security market.  This requires solutions which tightly integrate the functional components in one package, providing for comprehensive security and centralized management.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company's customers include diverse organizations</B> primarily in the financial, communications, and government markets, including Banc One Services Corporation, BayBank Systems, Fuji Capital Markets Corporation, the National Security Agency, and Visa International.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>V-ONE has entered into several important strategic alliances</B> which should extend its penetration in both the U.S. and international markets.  The Company has agreements with MCI, GE Information Systems, and Lockheed Martin, and has established reseller relationships with 15 domestic and international distributors.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Over the next year, we expect that the Company will demonstrate rapid revenue and earnings growth</B> as customers move to full deployment, and as strategic partners and reseller channels begin to produce results.  To date, much of the Company's sales activity has focused on seeding the market through customer pilots and building strategic relationships.</UL>
<P></P>

<B><I>Company Background</I></B>
<P>
Based in Rockville, Maryland, V-ONE was incorporated in February 1993, and reincorporated in Delaware in February 1996.  From February 1993 until December 1994, the Company focused primarily on personnel recruitment and research and development, with revenues comprised mainly of consulting and related services.  V-ONE introduced its first product, the SmartCAT smart card reader and application software, in June 1994.  In December 1994, the Company introduced the SmartWall application-proxy firewall, which accounted for the bulk of product revenue in 1995.  Its third product, Smart GATE, a client/server security enabling product, was introduced in December 1995.  Over time, V-ONE has developed and is now marketing a comprehensive, modular suite of security product.  The Company has offices in Rockville, New York and San Francisco and the number of employees has grown from 30 at year-end 1995 to 75 today.

<P>
Value Health offers managed care information services, pharmacy benefits, mental health management, and other specialty services to large self-insured corporations, insurance companies, and managed care organizations. The recent merger with Diagnostek strengthens the Company's competitive position in the pharmacy market, while the information services division prepares Value Health for the changes in health care.  We rate the stock as STRONG BUY (1) based on 1996 earnings per share of $2.28 and a long-term growth rate of 25%.  This generates a twelve-month price target of $57, which represents price appreciation potential of 63% from current levels.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Value Health should be a major participant in the next wave of managed care. </B> The management has proven itself to be flexible to the changing market and capable of delivering profit growth to investors.  Its services are information based, which is important because the health care market is strangely devoid of the widespread database and computational technologies taken for granted in other industries.  Finally, Value Health has shown that its services are attractive to a variety of customers including indemnity, managed care, and government payers as well as providers of health care products and services.  We expect the Company to extend its reach beyond niches into group health. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Information Services offers an outstanding growth opportunity. </B> As pharmaceutical manufacturers and others look at disease management, or managing the process of care rather than the products used, Value Health stands to benefit.  Its Value Health Sciences division provides clinical information services for disease management to Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.  Since this division is more profitable than the Company's other businesses, any new contracts are disproportionately positive news.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>The Company is a leader in providing sophisticated pharmacy benefits services. </B> The services of the Value Rx group appeal to large employers who want to save money while protecting quality of care, including Ford Motor (and the United Auto Workers), American Express, and the State of New York.  Clinical drug usage protocols help differentiate the Company from competitors and provide a long-term basis for growth.  Continuing inefficiencies in prescription drug prices at the retail level alone will maintain demand for services. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Value Health's merger with Diagnostek creates a leading position in pharmacy benefits management.</B>  The Company is now the largest independently-owned pharmacy benefits manager and the second-largest wholly-managed program.  It offers claims processing, a pharmacy network, a mail order pharmacy, and a full formulary.  Diagnostek handles the mail order portion of pharmacy benefits managed by other companies;  this presents a great cross-selling opportunity. </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
VitalCom, Inc. is the leading provider of real-time communications networks that centralize the management, interpretation, and distribution of  patient physiologic parameters generated by point-of-care monitoring systems located throughout a healthcare enterprise.
<P>
We expect VitalCom to grow earnings at least 35% annually over the next few years due to (i) rapid market growth in a niche with few competitors, (ii) the Company's excellent client retention and reference base, (iii) strong core products with demonstrable ROI, and (iv) new sales and marketing initiatives.  Our one-year price target is $20, and our rating is <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B>.
<P>

 
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<UL><LI> 
<I>Leading Provider of Real-Time Communications.</I> VitalCom is a technology company providing real-time patient data networks that integrate individual proprietary patient-monitoring technologies.  The Company differentiates itself by capitalizing on leading-edge software that can execute such tasks as signal processing, process efficiencies, real-time data distribution, and elaborate analysis programs. VCOM's real- time, open networks afford clients the means to reengineer labor-intensive delivery processes and provide demonstrable ROI (an increasing priority of software system purchasers).

</UL><UL><LI><I>Large and Growing Market.</I>  Virtually all hospitals in the U.S. are plagued with high labor costs and increasing patient acuity.  These challenges place a premium on hospitals' ability to improve efficiency and reduce costs.  Effective access to patients' current (acute) physiologic data is essential to improving clinical care and reengineering labor-intensive delivery processes that impact operating costs.  
</UL><UL><LI> 
This situation is creating a large market for complex, real-time computer networks that (i) integrate and share patient data among different vendors' products, allowing hospitals to embrace a wide range of technologies, (ii) support transmission of technical, clinical, and patient demographic data to any location within the facility, or even to and from other facilities, (iii) provide one central acquisition point that accepts data from all monitoring sources and locations and distributes the data to wherever the caregiver may need it, and (iv) interface with mainstream healthcare information system (HCIS) computer networks.  The market for real-time, enterprisewide networks should grow from about $250 million today to over $1.0 billion by the year 2000.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Solid Fundamentals.</I>  VitalCom has a three-year history of consecutive profitability; an installed base of over 80 leading healthcare organizations (e.g., Kaiser Permenente, Dartmouth Medical Center, Henry Ford Medical Center); demonstrated ability to develop and market real-time software systems; and a large roster of "connectivity partners," including Johnson & Johnson, Protocol, Datascope, and Nellcor Puritan-Bennett.  We also think the Company has excellent depth and breadth of management. 
 
</UL><UL><LI><I>Copious Future Opportunities.</I>  The Company's excellent reputation, large client base (over 80 clients), and real-time software and communications expertise provide tremendous opportunity to (i) extend its product and service offerings, (ii) cross-sell new products and services to existing customers, and (iii) develop alliances with HCIS vendors to link real-time patient information with electronic medical records applications.  </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Vitalink provides pharmacy services to nursing homes and is a pioneer in developing pharmaceutical care formularies for geriatric use.  The Company monitors drug usage and patient care to help improve the health of nursing home residents and to assist nursing homes comply with federal and state regulations.  We think the stock has long-term potential and rate it as a BUY (2) with a 12-month price target of $24, based on calendar 1997 (the Company's year-end is May) earnings per share estimated at $1.34 and a long-term EPS growth rate of 18%.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Sophisticated services.</B>  The Company provides sophisticated levels of pharmaceutical care within a price-controlled environment.  Vitalink's excellent service ensures the Company benefits from upgrades in nursing home care, including increased emphasis on better use of medication and expansion in subacute care. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Successful market consolidator. </B> Compared to smaller, fragmented competitors that cannot adequately compete in the newly regulated environment, Vitalink is ahead of the game.  The Company currently has 2.6% market share nationally, and 4.2% in its existing markets.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Favorable demographics. </B> The stock offers a way to play the favorable long-term demographics of an aging population without much exposure to health care reform risk, because nursing home reimbursement is already constrained. </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Increasing demand due to government regulation.</B>  Government at the state and federal level is increasing its scrutiny of nursing homes, placing those companies providing value-added services in an excellent position to grow by helping nursing homes upgrade.  Despite proposed changes in federal law, Congress probably does not have the stomach to repeal the regulations in place now and return nursing homes to a more dismal state.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>Vivra operates dialysis centers and other specialty outpatient care businesses, with dialysis contributing 85.3% of revenue for the fiscal year ended November 1994.  While the business is appealing, the Company's value seems to be fully reflected in the stock price.  We rate the stock as NEUTRAL (3) with a $29 target over the next twelve months based on 1996 earnings per share estimated at $1.94 and an 15% long-term growth rate. 
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</B></I>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The dialysis business is stable and provides good support for the other businesses.</B>  Although the Company's market share is about 6%, it is growing through acquisition, slight changes in payor mix, and longer lives among existing patients. Since the incidence of kidney failure increases with aging, the pool of new end stage renal disease patients should continue to grow.</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Vivra is taking its renal expertise and using it to build other disease-specific programs.</B>  Dialysis treats one condition, end stage renal disease, so Vivra has developed considerable expertise in managing a specific disease.  The Company is interested in building from this expertise to manage other diseases and has made entries through acquisition into the diabetes market, which fits because complications of diabetes are a common cause of kidney failure, and allergy/asthma, another chronic disease.  Revenue from these other chronic condition programs are expected to contribute 8.8% of revenue in fiscal 1995.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Vivra's strong balance sheet and cash flow should allow for excellent future growth. </B> New business expansion requires financing, and Vivra's strong internally generated cash flow should help provide it.  In 1994, cash from operations was $43.4 million and total cash generated was $26.9 million.  In 1995, cash from operations is estimated at $40.9 million.  There is less than $5.0 million in long-term debt on the balance sheet on an equity base of $263.5 million (after the February, 1995 secondary offering).  </UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Earnings per share growth is healthy.</B>  Our estimates assume that earnings per share increase by 17.3% in fiscal 1995 (November) to $1.70 per share from the $1.45 reported in fiscal 1994.  For fiscal 1996, the expectation is for 14.6% growth to $1.94. Revenue is expected to grow by 22.1% in fiscal 1995 to $347.7 million from the $284.6 million reported in fiscal 1994 and by 14.1% in fiscal 1996 to an estimated $396.8 million.   </UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Wang Laboratories, Inc. (Wang) has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization with a strong balance sheet, a lower cost operating structure, and a streamlined business organization led by new management.  With the recently announced acquisition of a number of businesses from Groupe Bull (Bull), Wang is poised to experience significant growth in revenues and cash flow for the fiscal year 1995 and beyond.  As investors become aware of Wang's new story, we think the stock can trade at a cash flow multiple of 5 times yielding a target price of $11 7/8 in the next twelve months.
<P>
<B><I>Summary Points</I></B>
<P><UL><LI><I>Emergence from Chapter 11.</I>  Wang has emerged from chapter 11 with a strong balance sheet, a new management team, and a new organizational structure focused on providing software and services that define, automate, manage, and measure critical business processes.</UL>

<UL><LI><I>Three Pronged Organization.</I>Wang is now organized into three integrated businesses: <BR><BR>1) The Workflow Software and Imaging Bushiness unit concentrates on providing workflow, integrated imaging, document management, and related office software for client-server open systems.<BR><BR>
2)The Customer Services Business unit provides support, expansion and network integrating options for current customers using the VS product line, as well as support services for other vendors' hardware and software products.<BR><BR>
3) The Solutions Integration Business unit focuses on providing integration and support services for the U.S. Federal government and related agencies, as well as the other selected vertical markets.</UL>

<UL><LI><I>Groupe Bull Acquisition.</I>  Wang has announced that it will acquire a number of businesses from Bull beginning in January 1995, including: (i) Bull's worldwide workflow and imaging software business, (ii) Bull's U.S. Federal systems business, and (iii) Bull's customer service business in the U.S.  These units will fit within Wang's new business structure, and should contribute to revenue, EPS and cash flow.</UL>
<UL><LI><I>
New Management Team.</I>  Wang's new management team is led by Joe Tucci, formerly of Unisys, who was named CEO in January 1993  and Chairman in October, 1993.  He has assembled a top notch management team including Don Casey, who was previously at Lotus, Apple, and IBM, as president, and head of Wang's workflow software and imaging business.
</UL>
<UL><LI><I>
Strong Financial Condition.</I>  At the end of Q1:95 (September 1994), Wang had cash of $184.2 million, only $11.4 million in debt, $55.2 million in preferred stock (structure like debt), and equity of $265.3 million.  After the Bull acquisition, we expect Wang to have cash of $109.2 million, $101.4 million in debt, $55.2 million in preferred stock and another 1.6 million in common shares outstanding.</UL>
<UL><LI><I>
Projected Growth in Revenue and Cash Flow.</I>  For the year ended June 30, 1994 Wang had revenue and cash flow of $855.3 million and $86.5 million respectively.  We estimate that for June 1995, Wang will have revenue and cash flow of $964.2 million and $92.5 million respectively.</UL>


<UL><LI><I>Attractive Valuation.</I>  A valuation based on a multiple of cash flow is more appropriate than a valuation based on reported earnings due to the large amount of non-cash amortization charges Wang must continue to report as it emerges from bankruptcy.  We believe an appropriate target valuation to be 5 times projected 1995 cash flow, or about $11 7/8 per share.</UL>

<P>
Whittman-Hart is a rapidly growing supplier of information technology (IT) services to mid-market companies.  The Company offers a broad range of IT services including application-package implementation, custom-software development, workgroup computing, system engineering, and technology/business planning.  These services allow Whittman-Hart's customers to benefit from the significant advances in computer technology without employing in-house a large and sophisticated staff. The average P/E multiple on CY96 EPS estimates for comparable information technology service providers is 56x (higher than Whittman-Hart's P/E multiple). Our 12-month target price of $56.25 is based on a conservative P/E multiple of 45 times our FY98 EPS of $1.25. We rate the stock a Buy (2).

<P><BR>
<UL><LI><B>
Enormous market a with broad range of requirements  . </B>The market for information technology consulting and systems integration services is large and well established.  Organizations such as Whittman-Hart serve a well documented need to augment the internal technical capability of business seeking to build next generation business systems. International Data Corporation estimates the domestic market for services like those provided by Whittman-Hart was $34 billion in 1995 with 14% projected growth.  Dataquest Worldwide Services Group estimates the worldwide market for IT services will reach $292 billion by 2000.  
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Mid-market focus.</B>   Whittman-Hart is a rapidly growing supplier of information technology (IT) services to mid-market companies and divisions of Fortune 1000 organizations. The Company offers a broad range of IT services including application package implementation, custom software development, workgroup computing, system engineering, and technology/business planning.  These services allow Whittman Hart's customers to benefit from continuing advances in computer technology without employing in-house large and sophisticated staffs. The Company serves clients in a broad range of industries, including communications, consumer products, distribution, financial services, insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, professional services, retail and technology.  By focusing on companies with revenue of $50-500 million or similar sized divisions of Fortune 1000 organizations the Company has discovered a niche essentially ignored by the major consulting companies. The major vendors of IT integration services, have created business models and pricing structures incompatible with the needs of all but the largest business enterprises.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Growth oriented business strategy.</B>    Whittman-Hart has made substantial investments of time and financial resources into the development of systems, methodologies, training programs and infrastructure capable of supporting a much larger organization.  The Company is pursuing its strategy to become the leading single source provider of IT services to mid-sized companies. These investments have enabled the Company to expand rapidly, while improving operating margins. During 1995, revenue expanded 69% to $49.8 million, and 80% in the first three quarters of 1996 to $62.2 million (without any acquisitions), while operating margins expanded from 4.2% to 7.5%, respectively.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Local presence.</B>   An increasingly critical factor in the Company's success is its commitment to offering a local presence through branch offices and client support centers.  The Company demonstrates its commitment to each local market and enhances its ability to attract skilled, locally-based consultants by delivering its services to clients through a branch network.  This network also increases consultant productivity and satisfaction, enhancing responsiveness and minimizing travel expense.  Furthermore, the local branch offices establish greater name recognition for the Company and increase referrals for its services within the local potential client base.  Currently, Whittman-Hart has operations in 6 cities, centered in the mid-west. We expect continual expansion to new locations, through internal start-ups and acquisition. The Company has targeted 25 cities as potential branch office locations.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Competitive edge.</B>   In situations where a detailed proposal is undertaken, the Company has experienced a win rate over 50% by contract value.  Factors responsible for Whittman-Hart's success include access to senior management, a higher percentage of experienced consultants, lower cost,  greater flexibility, and a practical approach to project management.  As a result, we expect Whittman-Hart to continue to grow substantially faster than the overall market.  
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Risk factors.</B>  Presently, Whittman-Hart is starting to bid more frequently on larger projects in the $1.0 million class.  While the Company has executed client engagements of this size, management has limited experience in this market and must gain more experience in projects of this magnitude. In addition, the Company makes an up-front investment (accounted for as an ordinary operating expense) of approximately $1.75 million in a new branch prior to generating material revenue. Lastly, Whittman-Hart has targeted acquisitions as a part of its growth strategy. Management has minimal experience in this area, which can be a mine-field for small growing companies.
</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>
Forecast.</B>    We estimate that on revenue growth of 72.6% in 1996 to $86.0 million, the Company will generate EPS of $0.59, a 245% increase from the $0.17 reported in 1995. For 1997, we project a further 41% increase in revenues, and a 45% increase in EPS, to $0.86. We expect operating earnings to grow faster than revenue as the company benefits from investments in infrastructure made in 1995. We project operating margins of 8.0% in 1996, compared to 3.4% in 1995. We expect continued operating margin expansion in 1997 to 9.7%, and in 1998 to 11.0%.</UL><BR><UL><LI><B>

Price target makes Whittman-Hart an attractive investment.</B>  Whittman-Hart's stock is now trading at a P/E of 75x our estimated 1996 EPS of $0.59, and 51x our estimated 1997 EPS of $0.86.  We base our 12 month price target of $56.25 on a 45x P/E on projected 1998 EPS of $1.25.  Currently, the comparable company average is trading at a 56x P/E on 1997 EPS and has a projected 28% revenue growth rate as compared to our estimated 45% for Whittman-Hart.</UL>

<BR><P>
Premenos, the first company to offer software and services for conducting secure and reliable business to business electronic commerce over the Internet, is poised to experience 55% growth in revenue and over 100% EPS growth through 1997.  Based on the enormous potential for Internet electronic commerce and Premenos' opportunity to establish itself as the market leader, we are initiating coverage with a <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> rating and a twelve month price target of $56.
<BR><P>
<I><B>Summary Points</B></I>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI><B>A leading player in the large and growing electronic commerce market. </B> The market can be categorized in two ways: business to business, and business to consumer.  Premenos is a leader in the business to business segment.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
The first secure and reliable business to business electronic commerce application on the Internet.</B> In May 1995, Premenos introduced Templar, an integrated software and service solution designed to enable the transmission of secure, digitally-signed documents, including EDI documents over the Internet.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>Leading supplier of EDI software and services for the mid-range market.</B> This software translates information from a business' internal application format to and from the major EDI standards.  In 1994, Premenos had 31% of the mid-range translator software market.</UL><UL><LI>
<I>Experienced, motivated management team.</I> Senior management has a collective 18 years of experience working at Premenos and owns 31% of the Company.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Blue chip customer base.</B> Premenos has an installed base of over 3,500 units of its translator software.  These customers are all targets for the new Templar Internet products.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>Large market opportunity.</B> In 1994, approximately $700 million was spent worldwide on EDI software and services.  This market is forecast to grow to approximately $2.7 billion in 2000.  This market estimate does not reflect the positive impact from moving EDI to the Internet.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>
Strong, accelerating revenue growth. </B> Premenos experienced a 49% CAGR in revenue from 1991 -1994.  We expect the growth rate to accelerate to 50% in 1996, and 58% in 1997.</UL>

<UL><LI><B>Profitable, estimated rapid growth in EPS in 1996 and 1997.</B>
Premenos was profitable in 1993 and 1994.  EPS are estimated to decline from $0.28 in 1994 to $0.06 in 1995 due to the investment in the Templar Internet products and services.  EPS are estimated to increase to $0.30 in 1996, and $0.60 in 1997.</UL>

<H2>MANAGED CARE: HMO INDUSTRY AT THE CROSSROADS</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>July 1, 1996</FONT>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=580>
<TR><TD WIDTH=150></TD>
<TD WIDTH=430>
<P></P>

<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<P>
As second quarter earnings reports are likely to elucidate, 1996 is shaping up as another tough year for the managed care industry. Individual companies always have specific causes for their problems. Trouble digesting acquisitions, pricing pressures, startup losses in new markets or with new products, and provider intransigence are often cited as the sources of an earnings shortfall. However, the accumulation of many such issues is indicative of an industry problem.
<P>
To fully reflect the reality that business conditions are generally weak and that individual companies are far more likely to generate an earnings disappointment than an upside surprise, we have taken a scalpel to our EPS estimates for 1996 and 1997. We suggest that investors underweight this sector, and we caution speculators that M&A activity is highly unlikely to rescue underwater positions. Our purchase recommendations are limited to Oxford Health Plans (Strong Buy); Foundation Health and Health Systems (both rated Buy). In particular, we believe that Oxford Health and Health Systems, along with United HealthCare (not rated), have advanced the furthest in strategically repositioning their health plans to meet the changing needs of members, plan sponsors, and providers.
<P>
<B><I>Pricing</I></B>
<P>
Premium levels for 1996 in the commercial segment appear insufficient to meet targeted margin levels. In the second half of last year, many HMOs indicated the need for 2-4% premium increases, a prudent forecast given the inflection in utilization trends that became evident in early 1995. However, few health plans achieved premium increases of any magnitude this year, leaving their profit margins highly exposed to even minor blips in utilization.
<P>
Why isn't pricing firmer?  We don't believe it's due to a surfeit of plans, as the number of competitors in most major markets is not materially higher than was the case a few years ago. We believe the root cause is a lack of differentiation among health plans, leading to commodity-like pricing. HMOs, Blues, and indemnity insurers alike now offer a full spectrum of PPO, basic HMO, POS, and self-funded products. Network differentiation between plans has faded as most providers have sought as many managed care contracts as possible. The trend toward full-risk capitation assures buyers (i.e., plan sponsors) that identical plan designs with identical provider networks will be executed in an identical fashion by competing HMOs; ergo, the lowest price wins. Although two years of rising utilization should curb the most aggressive tendencies to discount, we do not anticipate a greatly improved pricing environment in 1997.
<P>

<B><I>Hospital Utilization</I></B>
<P>
Some of the most important contributions to the HMO industry's favorable medical cost trend in the 1989-1994 period were achieved in the inpatient category. Hospital utilization, as measured by annualized bed-days per 1,000 enrollees, declined steadily in all regions. Health plans achieved significant cost savings by i) shifting procedures to outpatient settings such as surgery centers; ii) substituting skilled nursing facilities and other subacute providers for hospital-based care; and iii) negotiating aggressive discounts on per diem hospital rates.
<P>
However, over the last 18 months, we have seen a leveling off in bed-days at many HMOs. This trend has been as pronounced on the East Coast, where inpatient measures often remain above 250 bed-days per year for commercial members, as on the West Coast, where the state-of-the-art is 200 or fewer bed-days.
<P>
Furthermore, legislators in a number of states have responded to consumer concerns over "drive-through deliveries" and other alleged abuses by mandating minimum stays for maternity cases. The recent debate over parity for mental health coverage illustrated how easily activists and providers can mobilize legislatures to mandate minimum-treatment options. High-profile actions such as these can have a chilling effect on discharge planners.
<P>

<B><I>Pharmacy</I></B>
<P>
Prescription drugs stand out as the single category of medical expenses with the highest rate of inflation in 1996. In the March quarter, many HMOs reported that per member pharmacy costs were rising at a 10-20% rate on a year-over-year basis. List-price increases, the use of newer (more expensive) formulations in lieu of older compounds, and the substitution of drug therapy as an alternative to surgery or, in the case of psychiatric drugs, talk therapy, probably accounts for only a third of this increase.
<P>
The balance of the price increase is due to the pharmaceutical manufacturers' withdrawal of the large front-end discounts formerly given to volume buyers such as HMOs. These front-end discounts were typically 10-15% of average wholesale price (AWP). From the perspective of the drug companies, such discounts were wasted on health plans whose formularies did little to shift market share. Significant discounts are now available only for HMOs able to demonstrate a decided preference for one drug over another. 
<P>
The HMO industry's response to this trend is likely to be the introduction of very narrow, highly restrictive formularies with blunt methods of enforcing compliance. Foundation Health is testing these waters, having eliminated Johnson & Johnson and Merck drugs from its approved formulary last month. However, even absent such decisive steps, the pharmacy expense trend will recede in 1997 as health plans anniversary the elimination of front-end discounts.
<P>
<B><I>Outlook</I></B>
<P>
In a typical underwriting cycle, HMOs endure three years of profit margin compression, followed by three or more years of robust earnings expansion.  If we are on the downward leg of an underwriting cycle, its starting point can be traced to 1995, implying little improvement in fundamentals before 1998.
<P>
The current malaise is also likely to trigger a broader restructuring of leadership within the HMO industry.  The most successful companies in this industry have generally been the most innovative, those willing to break the mold. Thus, the IPA/Network model plans displaced their staff model predecessors as the dominant form of HMO.  More recently, HMOs willing to wholeheartedly commit to POS products pushed aside competitors wedded to the more restrictive basic HMO.  The lesson here is to give customers what they want.
<P>
Tomorrow's customer wants demonstrably superior quality, so we expect some companies to shift the terms of competition from price to expected outcomes.  To actually achieve such an advantage will require meaningful changes in medical cost management, provider contracting and member services.

<I><B>Investment Thesis</B></I>
<BR><P>
The spectacular growth of the computer networking industry over the last decade produced exceptional investment returns. We expect this trend to continue, driven mainly by the deployment of next-generation networks, growth of the Internet and remote local area network (LAN) access. We predict that they will become multibillion dollar markets, growing to around $7.4 billion by 1998. The winners will be those companies that are technology leaders, have broad product lines, and are able to penetrate important international markets.
<BR><P>

<B><I>Summary and Conclusions:</I></B>
<BR><P>

<B><I>Emerging Applications Need More Bandwidth</I></B>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI>Client-server solutions and emerging multimedia applications need large amounts of bandwidth to function efficiently over LANs.
<P>
<LI>Networks using Ethernet and Token Ring are running out of bandwidth, and both these technologies are reaching the limits of their performance.
<P>
<LI>Few companies today can afford to build new network infrastructures from scratch. Instead, they want to maximize their investments by addressing the shortcomings of present networks and then gradually migrating to better technologies. 
</UL>
<BR>

<B><I>New LAN Technologies Enable Voice, Video and Data Traffic</I></B>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI>Several technologies have emerged with the most promising being two switching technologies: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and LAN switching. They both speed up existing networks but only ATM can readily transport voice, video and data, and operate over both LANs and wide area networks (WANs).

<P><LI>While ATM is perceived as the networking technology of the future, it is still evolving and suffers from high initial entry cost. This situation is unlikely to change much before 1997 when standards solidify and more vendors enter the market. The market for ATM LAN products will be small until then, but demand could explode in 1997, growing to more than $900 million by 1998.

<P><LI>The extent to which ATM is deployed in LANs will be influenced by improvements in LAN switching, a technology that readily improves Ethernet and Token Ring while providing some of the features of ATM. LAN switching increases bandwidth for today's applications and, unlike ATM, does not require costly changes to existing infrastructure. With many companies embracing this technology, the LAN switching market is projected to develop from $320 million in 1994 to over $2 billion by 1998, a compound growth rate of 60%.

<P><LI>The benefits of LAN switching also means that many companies will not readily replace their Ethernet and Token-Ring networks with ATM, especially to the desktop. Instead, they will initially focus on improving performance on the LAN backbone by using ATM in place of Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), and then gradually adopting ATM to the desktop as prices start falling. ATM will, therefore, coexist with LAN switching for several years.
</UL>

<BR><P>
<B><I>Strong Growth in Remote Access</I></B>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI>The growth in demand for remote-office connectivity, the increasing number of telecommuters and other mobile workers, and the popularity of the Internet are driving strong demand for remote access products. Sales of remote LAN access products are estimated to grow from $700 million in 1994 to around $4.3 billion by 1998, a compound growth rate of 57%.

<P><LI>The same factors have also boosted demand for ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), a low-cost switched technology that provides higher speeds than analog modems, and is more economical than using leased lines. Nearly $900 million of the sales of remote LAN access products is expected to be ISDN related.
</UL>
<BR><P>

<B><I>Excellent Opportunities in International Markets</I></B>
<BR><P>
<UL>
<LI>After a slow start, many overseas markets are installing LANs at a rapid pace. Their lack of a large, installed base of networks also means that businesses in these countries can adopt state-of-the-art products. 

<P><LI>Many networking vendors will, therefore, experience their fastest growth outside North America. It is also likely that the initial market for their latest and, more likely, higher margin products will no longer be confined to the U.S.
</UL>
<BR><P>

<B><I>Industry Consolidation Continues</I></B>
<BR><P><UL>
<LI>The trend toward consolidation of the industry is being spurred by the rise of switching and remote access markets. Several start-up companies pioneered products for these markets and in the process challenged the entrenched vendors. Incumbents responded via internal development programs of their own, through alliances, or by acquiring companies with key skills. 

<P><LI>Consolidation is expected to continue as vendors seek advanced technologies and enter different segments of the networking market. Small companies with innovative ideas are likely to be acquired and mergers between midsized vendors are likely to increase.

<P><LI>The fundamental structure of the networking industry is also changing as the old distinctions between computer networking and telecommunications technologies fade. Furthermore, the impending deregulation of the telecommunications market promises to change many aspects of industry structure.

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>
Stents have revolutionized the treatment of atherosclerosis resulting in a commercial bonanza for many companies.  "Stent mania" will remain a potent driver of the interventional cardiology field and of the medical devices industry for many years.
<P>
Because of intensifying competition among stent manufacturers overseas and Johnson & Johnson's virtual monopoly in the U.S., we think the best way for investors to play the stenting phenomenon right now is not through the stent manufacturers themselves, but through companies with proprietary technologies that are applicable to a wide range of stent procedures - regardless of which brand of stent is being used.  Both CardioVascular Dynamics, Inc. and EndoSonics Corp. meet this standard.  We have <B>STRONG BUY (1)</B> recommendations on both stocks.


<P>
<B><I> Background</B></I><P>

An appreciation for the dynamics of the stent market is central to understanding the commercial opportunities facing CardioVascular Dynamics, Inc. and EndoSonics Corp.  Neither company is entirely dependent on the stent market, but each stands to gain significantly as stent utilization continues to grow. 
<P>
In our opinion, these two companies offer the best way to invest in the stent phenomenon.  As the number of balloon-expandable stent manufacturers proliferates and as the stent market matures, we think it will be more profitable in the long run to invest in suppliers of critical adjunctive products - such as stent delivery balloons and IVUS imaging systems that can be used with a variety of stent product lines - than in the direct, stand-alone stent suppliers.  Due to intense competition in Europe, we think balloon-expandable stents will come under significant pricing pressure soon.  In the United States, it remains to be seen whether Johnson & Johnson's patent portfolio will bar other makers of balloon- expandable stents from entering this lucrative market.
<P>
In 1994, when stents were introduced worldwide, these small intravascular implants were used in approximately 80,000 procedures, or roughly 11% of balloon angioplasties performed.  This year, we estimate that some 350,000 stent procedures will be performed, representing a 40% penetration of angioplasty procedures.  We think the level of penetration will peak within the next couple of years at somewhere between 55-60%.
<P>
<B><I>If It's a Tube, Stent It!</B></I><P>
<UL><LI>Stents are tiny scaffolding devices that are used to prop open the tubular structures of the body.  Theoretically, stents can be used to create or maintain an opening in any tubular structure within the body that has become narrowed or blocked due to disease or injury - including the esophagus, the bile duct, the urethra, and the blood vessels.  As a Johnson & Johnson executive reportedly once said, "The human body is a big series of tubes just waiting to be stented."</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Stents have had their greatest impact in the field of interventional cardiology.  They have become indispensable in the treatment of atherosclerosis because they currently offer the most effective way to keep blood vessels open once the plaque has been treated.  In other words, stents are the only proven way to reduce the incidence of reclosure of the vessel, or restenosis - a medically and financially costly complication of angioplasty. 
</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Although the absolute number of stent procedures is likely to grow each year through the end of the decade, we think sales, as measured in dollars, are likely to flatten during the last two years of the decade.  Exhibit 2 gives our projections for cardiovascular stent sales through the year 2000, reflecting the effects of pricing pressures and the use of fewer stents per procedure.  These forecasts make rather conservative assumptions about stent price erosion.  Competition might drive even deeper price cuts than we have shown.  So even if stent utilization increases dramatically in such areas as the carotid and other peripheral arteries, we still think growth in the dollar value of sales will flatten out during the final years of the decade.</UL>
<P>
<B><I>CVD's Role in the Stent Phenomenon</I></B>
<P>
CVD stands to gain from the stent phenomenon in two ways:
<P>
<UL><LI>CVD has devised its own balloon-expandable stent, the FOCUSTENT, which it plans to launch in Europe during the fourth quarter of 1996.  The European stent market is becoming crowded, but we think CVD can gain some share of this market by bundling its stent with a proprietary balloon catheter for the delivery of the stent, as well as by pricing the stent significantly below the current average selling prices of the leading competitors.</UL>
<P>
<UL><LI> The company faces a much larger opportunity in the delivery of balloon- expandable stents - not only its own but those of dozens of other manufacturers.  In fact, we think CVD's Focus balloon, with its unique ability to offer differential inflation through the combination of compliant and noncompliant material on a single balloon, has the potential to become the world's preferred delivery vehicle for balloon-expandable stents.</UL>

<B><I>Investment Thesis</I></B>
<P>We expect CDP Technologies, Inc. (CDP), a provider of electronic information retrieval services to the medical market, to generate sales and EPS growth of 30% compounded for the next few years.  Despite the company's history of increasing revenue and earnings, and its exciting growth prospects, the stock is trading at only 12 times our estimate for 1995 EPS.  We are, therefore, initiating coverage with a <B>BUY</B> recommendation. 
<P>
<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<P><UL>
<LI><I>Leading Market Position. </I> CDP is a market leader in providing electronic information retrieval services to the biomedical and healthcare markets.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Powerful, Flexible Software. </I> CDP's proprietary OVID search software, which uses a common graphical user interface across several computing environments, enables the user to quickly and accurately locate citations and abstracts of biomedical and scientific articles.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Large Market Opportunity. </I>  CDP currently has about 20% share of the biomedical electronic bibliographic database market.  CDP plans to (i) expand into other vertical markets with electronic bibliographic databases and (ii) target the electronic full-text retrieval market, which is estimated to be a $2 billion potential market.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Strong, Motivated Management. </I> CDP's CEO, Mark Nelson, COO, Debbie Hull, and Chairman, Marty Kahn, have over 30 years experience as upper level managers of electronic information vending businesses.  Among the three, they own approximately 65% of the fully-diluted shares outstanding.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Profitable, Rapidly Growing Business. </I> CDP has been profitable since Q2:92.  Sales are estimated to increase 87% (35% internal growth, the rest from acquisition) and 32% in 1994 and 1995 respectively.  EPS are estimated to increase 67% and 150% in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Recurring Revenue Model. </I> CDP realizes recurring revenue in the form of annual database license fees and annual software maintenance fees.  During each of the last 3 years, more than 95% of subscribers to CDP's services renewed their subscriptions.

</UL><UL><LI><I>Attractive Valuation. </I>  CDP shares are currently trading at only 12 times 1995E EPS, despite an estimated sustainable growth rate of 30% for the next few years.  If CDP were to trade at a P/E multiple of 20 times 1995 estimated EPS of $0.50, the stock price would be $10 per share, 67% above today's prices.</UL>

<H2>SPINNING A WEB OF GOLD: THE STATE OF INTERNET CONTENT</H2>

<B><I>Industry Overview</I></B>
<P>
With the introduction of easy Internet access, friendly browsers, and search engines, the Internet and the World Wide Web (the graphical interface of the Internet) have achieved a level of popularity and usefulness unimaginable even one year ago. Consumers are getting connected and using the Web not only to find research on arcane topics, but also to get stock quotes, find out whether the Bulls destroyed yet another NBA team, listen to their favorite classic rock station, and make travel arrangements to Paris for the springtime.
<P>
Intrigue has driven the Internet's rapid growth to date. Content, though, will be the catalyst for future growth and acceptance  (see Exhibit1). Exceptional content will attract new users and bring veterans back for more. In many ways, the Web saga parallels television. Television executives were slow to understand the power of the visual. For some time they were merely repurposing content from popular radio shows. Creative people eventually figured out how to develop content for television that capitalized on the visual aspect of the new medium, and shows like "Gunsmoke," with its action-packed narrative and elegant, realistic Wild West setting, emerged. As the audience grew, so did network revenues and ultimately profits. "The $64,000 Question" is perhaps the best example of content capitalizing on the medium. The producers used close-ups of contestants' family members, shots of sweating brows of experts struggling to answer questions, and sets with impressively intimidating isolation booths and armed guards protecting the content of the questions. Quiz programs so compelled the American public that when they were broadcast, movie theater attendance and crime actually dropped. Unfortunately, "The $64,000 Question" was eventually found out to be rigged, but its ability to manipulate and capitalize on the visual realism of the medium can not be denied.   <P>
Within five years, nearly all PCs are expected to have Internet access, and 98% of Internet users are projected to be Web users.<P>

Early television focused on audio instead of visual. Like their TV predecessors, many Web developers are overlooking their technology's most stunning attribute, its interactivity. Initial Web sites have resembled on-screen brochures - flat and uninvolving. However, the Web changes daily. Creative souls, many of them tucked away in small start-ups, are in their cubes ferociously devising ways to get Web surfers hooked. With little sleep and the chance to make millions, these creators are quickly figuring out what Web surfers want to see. And just as in television, as the content becomes popular, the revenue opportunities increase. Advertisers flock to Seinfeld, ER, and 60 Minutes because of the draw and demographics of these shows. On the Web, early leaders like Pointcast, c|net, and Yahoo!, are attracting large and loyal followings, and are consequently starting to pull in the dollars.<P>


<B><I>Summary</I></B><P>
<UL><LI><B>The opportunity is here</B> Currently close to 20 million households worldwide are online (see Exhibit 2). In the U.S. alone, the approximately 10 million households now online are projected to grow to 35 million by 2000 (see Exhibit 3). Within five years, nearly all PCs are expected to have Internet access, and 98% of Internet users are projected to be Web users.</UL>
<UL><LI><B>
Content will drive revenues.</B> Money-making publishers will attract a large consumer base with compelling content. They will likely be risk-taking entrepreneurs uninhibited by tradition.
</UL><UL><LI><B>Advertising should be the main source of funds.</B> Advertising is a proven model for content-driven media (i.e., television), and it appeals to Web users' expectations of free content.

Other potential revenue models include membership fees, pay-to-play, and commerce. Ultimately, we think consumers will pay for perceived value, but given the quantity of free information, few content providers have been able to justify charging fees.   

</UL><UL><LI><B>Winning content will be user-friendly and broadly appealing. </B>Much of the rich CD-ROM content that consumers enjoy today, particularly games, is not well-suited to the Web.

The most successful online content will be designed so that bandwidth and latency constraints do not dampen the consumer's experience. 

The sites most likely to enjoy both financial and popular success will fall into the following areas: horizontal aggregators of broad categories of information, and vertical aggregators of specific information (e.g., multiplayer games, episodic entertainment, sports, music, travel, books), mostly in the entertainment arena.</UL>

<P>
<B><I>
Who's Surfing the Web?</I></B>
<P>
There are currently about 20 million World Wide Web users. U.S. users account for about 40% of the total. Despite these figures, adoption rates of enabling technologies suggest that much of the growth of the Web is yet to come (see Exhibit 4). An average Web user is a 31 year-old male. Only one-third of the Web population is female, but this portion is growing rapidly. As Exhibits 5 and 6 indicate, users are well-educated and have average incomes in excess of $60,000. Most log in from work and use the Web for entertainment or research, not shopping, and average about five and one-half hours per week on the Internet. 
<P>
Growth in online households will be driven by multiple factors like the inclusion of browsers in many hardware and software products, vendor initiatives such as the links between the proprietary online services (America Online and Compuserv) and Microsoft to use Internet Explorer as their primary Internet browser, and growing interest among consumers in personalized information and customized browsing.

<BR>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</B></FONT></H2>
</CENTER><BR>
<FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Federal Programs</B>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
The City of Mesa is an entitlement community that participates in the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) programs as well as Section 8 and the HOPE for Elderly Independence Rental Assistance Programs. For the federal programs described, except the HOME program, Mesa receives funding directly from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Funds received are to be used for affordable housing, homeless assistance, supportive housing and community development activities and efforts as further discussed in Section B of the 1996 Annual Plan.  (For housing activities refer to the Maricopa HOME Consortium 1996 Annual Plan.)
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Maricopa HOME Consortium
</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
For purposes of administrating the HOME program; Mesa, along with five other local municipalities and Maricopa County, formed the Maricopa HOME Consortium in 1991. Maricopa County was designated as the lead agency.  Consortium participants pool a 15% set aside of HOME funding each year for specific types of nonprofit organizations known as Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO's).  The balance of funds are allocated to member jurisdictions based on a prorata share.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Citizen Participation</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
The City of Mesa conducted two public hearings which were held in conjunction with the proposal application process for the CDBG, HOME, and ESG programs.  In addition to the two hearings, the City also held a public information meeting in the beginning of the application process; met with the Housing Advisory Board, representatives of neighborhood groups, Neighborhood and Community Assistance Office staff that administer the Community Aid Program, and Mesa Housing Authority staff; and met with or provided information requested from other City departments, nonprofit agencies, private developers, and the general public. <BR>
<BR>
Notices of meetings and public hearings were published a minimum of two weeks in advance in the local newspaper as required, were publicly posted, and were mailed to applicants and other interested persons.  A summary of projects proposed for funding in FY 1996/97 was published and distributed for comment. 
<BR>
<BR>
The City provided a thirty (30) day public comment period for this year&#146;s annual plan from March 11 to April 11, 1996.  One written comment was received from a local nonprofit housing organization, HFM.  The letter of comment and the City&#146;s response are included in the 1996 Annual Plan.  Information derived from neighborhood surveys, a petition submitted by the CANDO neighborhood, and comments made during public hearings on the 1996 Annual Plan as well as comments on proposed FY 1996/97 projects were considered by the City Council in approving final allocations.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Institutional Structure</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
</B>Within the City of Mesa organization are three divisions - Community Development, Mesa Housing Authority, and the Neighborhood and Community Assistance Office - that are primarily responsible for the management of housing, human service, and community development related programs for low income households and neighborhoods.  (The CDBG, HOME, and ESG programs are administered by the Community Development division.)  The programs managed by these divisions utilize federal, state, and local resources and work in partnership with public and private entities to achieve common goals of providing affordable housing, shelter and services for the homeless, and improving older neighborhoods.
<BR>
<BR><BR>
<H2><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Housing and Community Development Strategy</FONT></B></CENTER></H2>
<BR><BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Geographical Distribution</FONT></B>

<BR>
<BR>
For both housing and non-housing projects; CDBG, HOME, and ESG funded projects will be primarily situated in the designated CDBG Target Area which is generally bound by Horne Street on the east, Extension on the west, Eighth Street on the north, and Eighth Avenue on the south.  (Refer to Target Area map attached).  The designated Target Area is the oldest section of the City and contains the original square mile known as Town Center.  In addition to Town Center there are five other neighborhoods  that comprise the CDBG Target Area.  Generally found here is the older housing stock, lowest income households, and areas where homeless tend to congregate for food, shelter, and support services.<BR>
<BR>
Program activities outside the Target Area will be located in census tracts primarily occupied by low and moderate income individuals if the projects provide an area benefit, or will be in other areas of the City if serving special needs populations such as the elderly or disabled.<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Housing
</B></FONT><B></B><BR>
<BR>
The City of Mesa strives to provide the most comprehensive delivery of housing and services feasible through its federal and local programs.  In determining which activities to fund, the goal is to achieve a balance which addresses the needs of the homeless and special needs populations  and other low income residents.  For FY 1996/97, the City intends to implement emergency shelter, transitional, and permanent rental and homeowner programs.  The largest share of funds are to be used for single and multifamily housing rehabilitation and for new construction of two apartment projects which will offer affordable two, three, and four bedroom units.
<BR>
<BR>
The City finances a range of activities and supportive services not only from its federal resources, but also seeks other funding and continues to provide City general funds for housing activities from its own Community Aid program.  Additionally, to prevent the potential loss of adequate housing, nonprofit agencies conducting housing activities that are funded through the City from one of these federal resources are required to provide a broad range of appropriate case management and/or supportive services to the clients they serve.  
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Non-housing Community Development
<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
Non-housing community development activities funded for FY 1996/97 will  address the priorities discussed in the Five Year Consolidated Plan for the City of Mesa.  Most non-housing activities to be funded provide an area benefit within neighborhoods occupied by low and moderate income households.  Neighborhood preservation is a City wide focus as existing neighborhoods mature. The oldest areas of the City have and will continue to undergo revitalization using federal and local dollars for redevelopment and housing.  Adequate streetlighting continues to be a high priority particularly in the older, higher crime areas of the City.  Proposed neighborhood improvements will provide streetlighting within the designated CDBG Target Area, south of Broadway between Horne and Country Club.<BR>
<BR>
As described in the 1996 Annual Plan, the City will continue to fund park and other public facility improvements this coming year.  Proposed improvements also include renovations and replacement of playground equipment to meet ADA/Section 504 standards.  In conjunction with the Mesa School District, the City intends to construct a multi-use gymnasium on school property at the Jefferson Elementary School site for use by the school and the neighboring community.  Other non-housing activities include purchase of a building to be used for the expansion of client services by the MARC Center for developmentally disabled persons and funding to expand the United Food Bank facility. 
<BR>
<BR>
Activities in Town Center address redevelopment of the downtown area through neighborhood streetlighting and through rehabilitation of commercial properties to meet code requirements and provide facade improvements.  A program designed for the rehabilitation of commercial properties to meet code requirements and provide facade improvements, that received allocations in the two previous fiscal years, has remaining funds available.  Therefore, the City did not allocate funds for this program in the next fiscal year.
<BR>
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="Navy"><H2>Other Actions</H2></FONT></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing</FONT></B>
<BR>
<BR>
As part of its commitment to affirmatively further Fair Housing, the City completed a revised Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing in January, 1995 which details existing conditions affecting housing opportunities and defines strategies to create greater choices to all protected classes.  This analysis was again updated as a result of technical assistance provided by HUD through a locally sponsored training workshop attended by City staff in October, 1995. 
<BR>
<BR>
Overall in the City of Mesa, the greatest impediments to Fair Housing are lack of adequate income, which is very closely correlated with education and job opportunities, and the availability of affordable housing stock, particularly for large and small family households and the elderly.
<BR>
<BR>
The City of Mesa adopted a Fair Housing Ordinance in March, 1992 and intends to actively promote its nondiscriminatory policies to its citizens throughout the coming fiscal year. In addition to improved public awareness, the City will continue to offer liaison services; and as needed, advocacy services to those who wish to pursue further action through a formal discrimination complaint process.
<BR>
<BR>
For assistance, citizens may contact the City&#146;s Fair Housing Office at (602) 644-3660.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing</B></FONT>

<BR>
<BR>
In conjunction with its own housing programs, the City will continue to promote and encourage partnerships in FY 1996/97 with the private sector, nonprofit providers, financial lending institutions, other public entities and funding sources in creating and maintaining affordable housing for all classes of people.  Public policies and actions affecting the approval of sites and other building requirements used in the approval process for the construction of publicly assisted housing are continually reviewed and modified as necessary to augment the availability of  affordable housing.  Where the City has the authority to affect the development of affordable housing and supportive services, it will continue to take a proactive stance.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Evaluating and Reducing Lead-Based Paint Hazards</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Lead was banned from residential paint in 1978 and lead based paint hazards are expected to be most prevalent in units constructed before that time.  As a member of the Maricopa HOME Consortium, the City of Mesa will work closely with the Consortium to make every attempt to identify the extent of lead-based paint in its housing stock, specifically units built prior to 1978 that are occupied by low income families with children under 7 years of age.
<BR>
<BR>
All participants in the City's federally assisted housing programs administered through City departments or local nonprofit subrecipient agencies are advised of potential lead based paint hazards.  All receive the HUD brochure, &quot;Lead-Based Paint, A Threat to Your Children&quot;.  This material describes the hazards associated with lead paint particularly for small children.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="Navy"><B>Reducing the Number of Persons in Poverty</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Taking into consideration factors over which the City of Mesa has control, the City utilizes a comprehensive approach to address poverty among its most needy citizens.  The City coordinates with, and has allocated federal CDBG, ESG, and its own local funds for agencies providing assistance to those at risk and poverty level households.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Public Housing Resident Iniatives</FONT></B>
<BR>
<BR>
The City of Mesa's Housing Authority (MHA) does not participate in the Comprehensive Grant Program and does not have a formal resident initiative plan to involve public housing tenants in resident management or homeownership programs.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="Navy">Coordination between Agencies
</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="Navy"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
The City will continue to create partnerships between public institutions, nonprofit organizations, private industry, and other governmental jurisdictions and agencies for the delivery of  affordable housing and community development activities for low and moderate income households, older neighborhoods, and at risk populations.  The use of subrecipients to deliver such services has expanded, thus increasing the coordination and cooperation between the City and these entities.

Division Federal Programs Overview</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The City of Mesa is the third largest city in the State of Arizona with a population of approximately
 338,000 residents in a 122 square mile area. Mesa is considered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
 to be an entitlement community. As such, the City receives a set allocation of funds each year for certain federal programs.
 The amount allocated under each HUD program for the 1996/1997 federal fiscal year is as follows:</P>

<UL>               
 <A HREF="../comdev/page3.htm">Community Development Block Grant</A> (<B>CDBG</B>) $3,470,000<BR>
 <A HREF="../comdev/home.htm">HOME Investment Partnerships Program</A> (<B>HOME</B>) $750,743<BR>
 <A HREF="../comdev/esg.htm">Emergency Shelter Grant</A> (<B>ESG</B>) $90,000<BR></UL>

Of the total CDBG funds allocated, the City historically has used 40% - 60% for housing related activities. These activities are managed by the Mesa Housing Authority and by designated local non- profit agencies. The HOME Program is exclusively for the expansion of affordable housing, and ESG funds are used for sheltering the homeless or homeless prevention activities.<BR><BR>
The application process for these programs generally begins in December each year. The process includes hearings, application reviews, and City Council approval prior to selection of funded activities.<BR>
The general purpose of the federal programs is to serve low and moderate income persons (those whose household incomes are less than 80% of the area median income). Mesa Housing Authority (MHA) administers other federal programs for low income people, including a Section 8 assistance program, public housing, and residential rehabilitation programs.<BR>

The City of Mesa has participated in the Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) Program since 1975. During that period of
time, over $35 million has been allocated to Mesa for various
projects including housing rehabilitation, neighborhood improvements, 
park projects, Town Center redevelopment, and public services.

<P>In more recent years, the City has increasingly formed partnerships

previously done by the City itself. There has been a significant 
increase in the number of nonprofit agencies that have acted as
CDBG subrecipients. In 1991 three agencies contracted with the 
City for projects; there were nine agencies in 1996. Some of these organizations
have multiple contracts and are also recipients of HOME funding.</P>

<B>Background:</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Maricopa County, Arizona and the Cities of Chandler, Glendale, Mesa, Scottsdale, and Tempe entered
into a Consortium in 1991 for the purposes of receiving and administering federal HOME Investment
Partnerships Program funds. (The City of Peoria joined the Consortium in 1993) The Consortium agreed
to cooperate to undertake housing assistance activities as allowed under HUD HOME Program regulations.
<BR>
<BR>
Out of their total allocation of HOME funds, participants in the Consortium pool a 15% set aside as
required for specific types of nonprofit organizations known as Community Housing Development Organizations
(CHDO's). CHDO's apply directly to the Consortium for funding. The local governments each receive their
own pro rata share of the balance of funds available for locally designated projects.
<BR>
<BR>
Maricopa County was designated as the lead agency for the Consortium and thus assumed overall
responsibility for ensuring that the HOME Program was carried out in compliance with all requirements
including those requirements pertaining to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and
later the Consolidated Plan (CP).
<BR>
<BR>
As a participant in the Maricopa HOME Consortium, the City of Mesa receives a prorata share of the Consortium 
entitlement. For FY 1996/97 the amount available to the City under the HOME program is $750,743. Funds are to
be used for acquisition of units for permanent rental housing, single family reconstruction/substantial
rehabilitation, new construction of multifamily rental units, eligible CHDO operations, and administrative 
costs.<BR>

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><font size=3>F6 Internet Services has entered into an agreement with Magna Data, the <em>Internet Solutions 
Provider</em>, one of Australia's largest and most successful Internet services companies, to offer 
expanded capability for Wollongong. The new company is known as <strong>Magna Data-F6</strong>, providing 
superior service by combining the advantages of a local ISP with the economies of scale offered by a 
large national ISP. The Magna Data-F6 strong combination of local industry presence, Internet 
experience, product innovation and customer service, enables us to provide our clients with 
cost-effective solutions tailored to their needs. Magna Data-F6 offers clients a direct link to the US,

<h2><a name="AbouttheChange">About the Change</a></h2>
<p><strong>Magna Data-F6</strong> was officially introduced on October 1st, 1996. There are many benefits to joining 
this new service including fixed fee of $49 per month for dial up access, and extended hours for 
technical support. The old F6 service ceased from October 14th, 1996.</p>
<p>Due to the overwhelming demand for the more economical flat fee charging, we no longer offer 
hourly rates.<br>
<br>
Access equipment is located in Wollongong and the primary sales staff will be located here. 
Additional enhanced services are now available through Magna Data-F6.</p>
<h2><a name="SpecialOffer">Special Offer</a></h2>
<p>For those F6 customers who have not yet joined Magna Data-F6, we have extended our initial sign 
up offer. As a valued F6 customer, you still have the opportunity to join the new <strong>Magna Data-F6</strong> 
service between until November 14th at a special rate. By signing up for an initial three months 
<strong>before November 14th</strong> you will pay for only two. This means you pay just $98 for three months 
unlimited Internet access.<br>
<br>
What do you need to do?<br>
It is very simple to make the transition from F6 to Magna Data-F6. You need to return the form 
below to let us know you want to change over - we&#146;ll do the rest.</p>

<UL>
<LI>No event is more personal than your wedding. Small or large,
casual or formal, elegantly simple or elaborately embellished,
it's an individual statement that will become a special memory.
<LI>The staff of the Mesa Community and Conference Center believes
every couple deserves a wedding that reflects their unique relationship.
Here's how we can help you achieve this goal: 
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG><I>Personalized Attention </I></STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>When you reserve space for your wedding or reception, you
will be assigned an event coordinator. After listening to your
needs and preferences, they'll share ideas and develop a detailed
plan with all costs clearly spelled out. Your personal coordinator
will ensure staff support on thiss important day. 
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG><I>Flexibility</I></STRONG> 
<UL>
<LI>Our &quot;a la carte&quot; services allow you to mix and match
options, while our diverse facilities accommodate groups of 20
to 900. 
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG><I>Value </I></STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Our prices are among the lowest you'll find anywhere. You'll
get the most from your wedding/reception budget, and the savings
will be a bonus you can enjoy on your honeymoon! Additionally,
we offer a special honeymoon value package - our gift to you!

</UL>

<P>
<STRONG><I>Convenience </I></STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>We offer complete, one stop event services: <I>catering, liquor
services, and equipment rental</I> are easily arranged through
your event coordinator. And we're conveniently located in downtown
Mesa with plenty of free parking. 
</UL>

<P>
<B>Facilities</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Our most popular wedding/reception facility is the Rendezvous
Center. The newly-renovated Superstition Ballroom features a 50'
x 90' parquet floor great for dancing. The room can be divided
into two areas if a smaller space is needed.
<LI>Adjacent to the Ballroom, the Navajo Lounge makes a great
reception or bar area. The separate Apache Room is also often
used for receptions, luncheons, and dinner parties.
<LI>For large wedding events, you may wish to consider space in
Centennial Hall or the Centennial Conference Center. The rooms
in the newly-renovated Conference Center offer a variety of size
dimensions. The Palo Verde Room, for example, can be divided to
offer rooms from 1,522 to 4,567 square feet. If more space is
needed, Centennial Hall has a 100' x 150' main floor suitable
for large banquets and dances. 
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="Catering"><B>Catering</B> </A>
<UL>
<LI>Select from two professional caterers, each offering a variety
of tempting hors d'oeuvres, meals and baked goods in all price
ranges. The Community Center offers full liquor services for hosted
or cash bars.
<LI>To make your reception even more attractive, your booking
of a meal function entitles you to five hours complimentary room
space. 
</UL>

The Arizona Museum For Youth--a public/private partnership between the City of Mesa and the Arizona Museum for Youth Friends, Inc.--introduces children to the visual excitement and cultural enrichment provided by fine arts.  Our environment is especially designed to titillate the imagination, stimulate the mind, and captivate the eye.<P>
As one of two museums in the United States with a fine art's focus, the Arizona Museum for Youth is a very special family attraction.<P>
Each year three innovative exhibitions--corresponding to fall, spring, and summer school semesters--offer works of art installed at a child's eye-level.  Traditional museum displays are interspersed with participatory activities which enhance and reinforce the visual experience.


<h2>Current Exhibit:</h2>
<p>Trains and trucks, 'copters and cars, bikes and boats, planes and paddle wheelers....see artists' representations of these-- and more -- in the Arizona Museum for Youth's exhibit, <b>FLY, FLOAT & LOCOMOTE: Transportaion in Art.</b></p>

<p>"All children love things that soar through the air, float on the water, or roll over land," says Barbara Meyerson, the Museum's Executive Director.  "But, artists must love them, too, judging from the wonderful pieces of art we're exhibiting.  What a great summer offering for young visitors!"</p>

<p><b>FLY, FLOAT & LOCOMOTE,</B>which opens on June 14 and runs through September 13, 1996, features "transportation" art in a variety of mediums.  This diverse exhibit includes an outer space acrylic-on-canvas by noted artist Robert McCall, color lithographs by Luis Jimenez, a found-object truck by an anonymous Tarahumara artist, color photographs by Laurie Campbell, ceramics by David Gilhooly, and a carved-wood Noah's Ark by Jamie Maverick.  The exhibit will also display two large airplane models from Tucson's Pima Air and Space Museum and a model of Canada's prize-winning yacht, Bluenose, among many other wonderful works of art.</p>

<p>In-galery participatory art activities enhance appreciation of an art piece, of its medium, or of the artist's method.  Children make glow-in-the-dark paper airplanes, play a nautical board game, pose for a "photo" in outer space, design a vanity license plate, leave a secret message in a bottle, or sit in a real twenty-one-foot-long Brantley helicopter provided by the Valley Aircraft Restoration Society, among many other exciting activites!</p>

<BODY bgcolor="c0dcc0">
<H1><center>Park of the Canals/Brinton Desert Botanical Garden</center></H1><p>
<html>
In 1878, Mesa was founded by a group of Mormon Pioneers.  Upon exploration, they discovered a sophisticated irrigation canal system throughout the Salt River Valley vast enough to grow crops for 200,000 people.  The canals had been perfected about 2,000 years ago by a highly civilized Indian tribe.  Today we call them the Hohokam-The Departed Ones.  They were the first people to settle in Arizona.<p>

Archaeologists are unsure where these prehistoric people came from and why they mysteriously vanished, leaving behind their fields and canal systems.  Evidence of the worn canals can still be seen today at Park of the Canals.  The National Geographic Society has listed the park as an important prehistoric site.  The extensive desert botanical garden features vegetation from four desert regions including trees, shrubs, and hundred of different varieties of cacti.  A large playground area is available for children.  Free admission.  Open daily 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 1710 N. Horne.  969-1307.<p>

Fahlman, whose presentation is made possible through a grant from the Arizona Humanities Council, is an associate professor of art history at Arizona State University.  She is a specialist in American painting, sculpture, prints, photography and architecture from 1850 to 1945.<p>

<h1><center>Sirrine House</h1>
160 N. Center</center><p>
The Sirrine House Historic Museum, Mesa's first fully-restored Victorian era home, is open every weekend through March 31, with a variety of exhibits and programs planned.  The Sirrine House was built in 1896 by Mesa pioneer Joel Sirrine for his bride, Caroline Simkins of Lehi.  This lovely three-room house was restored to its original 1896-1904 appearance, the years during which Joel and Caroline lived in the house.<p>
Currently featured is an exhibit in the Sirrine House coach house, documenting the restoration of this facility.  Visitors may now see just how historic homes are preserved and restored, before or after their tour of the house itself.<p>
Restoration of the house is continuous, and volunteers are currently working on restoring some of the brickwork contained in the foundation and on the exterior walls.  Help is needed!  For information on volunteering for restoration, call the Southwest Archaeology Team at 827-7887.<p>
Don't miss the Sirrine House Centennial Celebration coming in the spring of 1996.  The Sirrine house will observe its 100th anniversary on May 18, 1996.  Special events and activities will begin in February.  Watch for more details to come!<p>
Guided tours by costumed docents are available free of charge during hours of operation.<p>
The Sirrine House is located at 160 N. Center St., Mesa (three blocks north of Main, on the southwest corner of Center and 2nd Street).<p>
Hours (subject to change):      Saturday, 10a-5p; Sunday, 1p-5p<br>
Admission:  Free

Ordinance.<BR><BR>

3.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, legal

which is severed from a larger parcel of property and acquired by
a public entity for public use by condemnation, purchase or
dedication may be relocated on the remaining parcel without
extinguishing the legal nonconforming status of that sign provided
that the nonconforming sign:<BR><BR>

<UL>(a)	is not increased in area or height;<BR><BR>

(b)	remains structurally unchanged except for reasonable
repairs or alterations;<BR><BR>

(d)	is relocated in a manner so as to comply with all applicable
safety requirements.<BR><BR>

</UL>After relocation pursuant to this subsection, the legal
nonconforming sign shall be subject to all provisions of this
Ordinance in its new location.<BR><BR>

or replaced unless it is brought into compliance with the
requirements of this Ordinance, except as provided in subsection
(B)3. of this Section.<BR><BR>

2.	Any construction permit which invokes Certificate of Occupancy
requirements shall specify and require that any nonconforming
sign located within the boundaries of the development site
authorized by said permit shall be brought into conformance with
the provisions of this Ordinance, provided that if the
nonconforming sign is a type of sign that is prohibited under
<A HREF="../planning/signord.htm#4429">Section 4-4-29</A> of this Ordinance, it shall be removed.<BR><BR>

3.	Any nonconforming sign shall be removed or rebuilt in full
conformity to the terms of this ordinance if it is damaged or allowed
to deteriorate to such an extent that the cost of repair or restoration
is 50% or more of the cost of reconstruction of such sign.<BR><BR>

4.	Any sign permit for a <b><A HREF="../planning/signord.htm#detachedsign">detached sign</A></b> within the boundaries of a
<b><A HREF="../planning/signord.htm#groupcoi">group C-O-I Development</A></b> shall specify and require that any

Administration and Procedures Chapter of the <A HREF="http://www.ci.mesa.az.us/codebook/main.htm">Mesa City Code</A>.  The
purpose of a Comprehensive Sign Plan is to provide for the

conditions, such as topography, proportion, size or relation to a
public street that would limit or restrict normal sign visibility; or<BR><BR>

characteristics of land use, architectural style, site location,
physical scale, historical interest or other distinguishing features
that represent a clear variation from conventional development; or<BR><BR>

as logos, emblems, murals or statuaries that are integrated with
the building architecture.<BR><BR>

		The construction and placement of individual signs contained in the
approved Comprehensive Sign Plan shall be subject to the issuance of
sign permits in accordance with Section 31 of this Chapter.<BR><BR>

</UL>	(O)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Sign Ordinance to the
contrary, any noncommercial message may be substituted for the
message on any commercial sign permitted by this ordinance, and any
other noncommercial message may be substituted for any
noncommercial message on any sign permitted by this ordinance.<BR><BR>

and <A HREF="../planning/signord.htm#4424">Section 4-4-24 </A> of this Ordinance are permitted only when
displayed in full conformance with the provisions of this Section.<BR><BR>

</UL>(Q)	Multiple colored bands, stripes, patterns, outlines or delineations
displayed for the purpose of commercial identification which constitute a
sign as defined in <A HREF="../planning/signord.htm#448">Section 4-4-8</A> of this Ordinance, and which exceed the
maximum permitted signage as specified in <A HREF="../planning/signord.htm#449">Section 4-4-9</A> through 4-4-17
of this Ordinance shall only be permitted upon a finding by the Design
Review Board, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the

<BR><B><A NAME="sub962a">(A)	OUTLINE OF PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS:</A></B><BR>
<BR>The preparation, submittal, review, and approval of all subdivision plats located inside the limits of the City of Mesa shall proceed through the following progressive stages:<BR>
<BR>Stage I    - Preapplication Conference<BR>
Stage II   - Preliminary Plat Approval<BR>
Stage III  - Technical Review<BR>
Stage IV   - Final Plat
<BR>This procedure may be modified by the Planning Director based on unique circumstances.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub962b">(B)	STAGE I -- PREAPPLICATION CONFERENCE:</A></B><BR>
<BR>1.	Actions by the Subdivider:<BR>
<UL>(a)	The subdivider shall meet with Community Development Department staff and submit five (5) copies of the proposed &quot;sketch plan&quot; with general information regarding land use, street and lot arrangement, tentative lot sizes, and such additional information as may be required by staff in order to complete the submittal.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Tentative proposals shall be based on information from the Engineering Department or other appropriate agencies regarding water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, retention, and street improvements.  Where methods may be considered unconventional, or private, these may be indicated by notes.</UL>
2.	Actions by the Department:<BR>
<UL>(a)	The Department shall discuss the proposal with the subdivider in general terms, advising the subdivider of the procedural steps, design and improvement standards, and general plat requirements.  Depending on the scope of the proposed development, the Department shall distribute the five (5) &quot;sketch plans&quot; to the following agencies, requesting that the following investigations be made:<BR>
<UL><BR>1)	Mesa Community Development Department:  To check the existing zoning of the tract and to make recommendations if a zoning change is necessary or desirable; to review the proposal and it's relationship to adjacent land uses; to determine the need for the preparation and review of a Development Master Plan ('DMP') prior to the subsequent consideration of a preliminary plat; and to advise the subdivider if a Development Master Plan is required as per Mesa's Zoning Ordinance.<BR>
<BR> 2)	Mesa Community Services Department:  To determine the degree of parks and other public open space requirements for the area; to then determine what space needs shall be reserved or set aside with any special requirements for such site; to determine how such space needs are to be acquired; and to request a meeting with the applicant to resolve potential acquisition.<BR>
<BR>3)	Public School District:  To determine the degree of need for school sites for the area; to determine site size and location; and to request a meeting with the applicant to resolve potential acquisition.<BR>
<BR>4)	Mesa Engineering Division:  To review relationship of property to major streets, utility systems and any unusual characteristics such as topography, flooding, landscaping etc.  To determine street width and right-of-way requirements, driveway relationships, minimum curve requirements and other traffic control related characteristics.</UL></UL>
<BR>3.	Development Master Plan:  The Department shall use the following guidelines in establishing the need for a &quot;Development Master Plan&quot; (DMP):  Whether the tract is sufficiently large to comprise an entire neighborhood; whether the tract initially proposed for platting is only a portion of a larger landholding of the subdivider; or whether the tract is a part of a larger land area, the development of which is complicated by unusual topographic, utility, land use, land ownership, or other conditions.  The entire land area considered in determining the need for a 'Development Master Plan' need not be under the subdivider's control or ownership <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf2">(see Figure 2)</A><BR>
<UL>(a)	Preparation:  The 'DMP' shall be prepared to a degree of scale and accuracy commensurate with its purpose, and shall include:<BR>
<UL><BR>1)	General street pattern with particular attention to collector streets and future circulation throughout the neighborhood and adjacent areas.<BR>
<BR>2)	General location and size of school sites, parks, or other public areas.<BR>
<BR>3)	Location and sizes of various proposed land uses.<BR>
<BR>4)	Methods proposed for sewage disposal, water supply and storm drainage.<BR></UL>
<BR>(b)	Approval:  Upon acceptance of the general design approach by the Department, the 'DMP' is submitted to the Board and City Council for their consideration.  If general approval is given, notice to that effect shall be recorded in the minutes of both bodies and a copy of said decision transmitted to the subdivider for his records.  If development is to take place in several phases the 'DMP' shall be submitted as supporting data for each part.  The 'DMP' shall be kept up-to-date and amended by the subdivider to reflect the Board's approvals or modifications as they occur.<BR></UL>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub962c">(C)	STAGE II -- PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL:</A></B><BR>
<P>The preliminary plat stage of land subdivision involves detailed subdivision planning, including the submittal, review, and approval of the preliminary plat.  The subdivider shall provide the Department with all information essential to determine the character and general acceptability of the proposed development.<BR>
<BR>1.	Zoning:  The subdivision shall be designed to meet the specific requirements of the zoning district within which it is located.  However, in the event that rezoning is deemed necessary, such as in the case of a 'PAD' or a &quot;Specific Site Plan&quot; approval for office, commercial or industrial developments, the rezoning or &quot;specific site plan&quot; approval shall be initiated by the property owner or his authorized agent, and heard and considered by the Board, the Design Review Board (DRB) if applicable, and City Council.  In any event, any change in zoning or site plan approval required in relation to the preliminary plat shall have been approved by the Board prior to approval of the preliminary plat by the Board.  However, the zoning request and the request for preliminary plat approval may be heard simultaneously.  The Department shall not proceed with processing of the preliminary plat for technical review prior to Board action on the preliminary plat unless approved by the Planning Director.<BR>
<BR>2.	Sanitary Sewerage and Water Supply:  As a prerequisite of preliminary plat approval, the Subdivider shall review tentative concepts with the County Health Department and the City Engineering Department for general approval of preliminary design to be used.<BR>
<BR>3.	Preliminary Plat Submission:
<BR><UL>(a)	Two (2) full-sized, 24&quot; x 36&quot;, blue or black line paper prints of the preliminary plat, one (1) 8&#189;&quot; x 11&quot; transparency, and one (1) 8&#189;&quot; x 11&quot; 'PMT' shall be filed with the Department not less than twenty-four (24) days prior to the Board meeting at which the plat will be considered.  (Note:  The submittal requirements given herein pertain only to those plats of a conventional nature for which rezoning is not a condition of approval.  Consult with the Department staff for complete submittal, time requirements and procedures for those subdivisions involving rezoning, 'PADs', specific site plans and DMP's.)<BR>
<BR>(b)	The submittal shall be checked by the Department for content.  If incomplete the subdivider will be notified and given the opportunity to comply within five (5) days.  If compliance has not been met, the submittal is rejected.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Filing Fee:  No filing fee is required except in cases involving rezoning, site plan approval, site plan modification and DMP approval.<BR></UL>
<BR>4.	Preliminary Plat Approval:
<BR><UL>(a)	The Board shall consider the preliminary plat and the Department recommendations.  If satisfied that all objectives and requirements of this Section have been met, the Board may approve the preliminary plat and the Secretary of the Board shall stamp a notation of approval on the copy retained in the permanent Board file.<BR>
<BR>(b)	If the plat is generally acceptable, but requires minor revision before proceeding with the technical review step, the Board may grant conditional approval and the required revisions will be noted in the minutes of the meeting.  At the direction of the Board, the plat may be given approval subject to the revisions in accordance with the stated conditions and reviewed by the Department.<BR>
<BR> (c)	If the Board finds that the plat requires major revision or if a plat is rejected, the application for preliminary plat approval may be continued pending revision or resubmittal for the same tract or any part thereof, and shall follow the aforementioned procedure.</UL>
5.	Significance of Preliminary Approval:  Preliminary approval consti- tutes authorization for the subdivider to proceed with submittal to the Technical Review Committee, prior to preparation of the final plat and the engineering plans and specifications for public improvements.  Preliminary approval is based on the following terms:
<UL>(a)	Subject to the basic approval:  The basic conditions under which preliminary approval of the preliminary plat is granted will not be substantially changed prior to the expiration date.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Twelve (12) month approval with extensions:  Approval is valid for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of Board approval.  Requests can be made for one (1) year extensions up to a total of not more than three (3) years from the original date of approval.  Extensions of the preliminary plat approval may be granted by the Board upon receipt of a letter from the subdivider prior to the expiration date.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Not authority to record:  Preliminary approval, in itself, does not assure final approval of the plat nor continuation of the existing zoning requirements for the tract or its environs, nor does it constitute authorization to record the plat.<BR></UL>

<BR><FONT SIZE=5><A NAME="sub963">9-6-3:</A><BR></FONT>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub963a">(A)	INTRODUCTION:</A></B><BR>
<BR>Every subdivision shall conform to the requirements and objectives of the General Plan, to the Zoning Ordinance, to other ordinances and regulations of the City, to the Arizona Revised Statutes and the Engineering Procedure Manual.<BR>
<BR> 1.	Where the tract to be subdivided contains all or any part of the site of a park, school, flood control facility, or other public area as shown on the General Plan or as recommended by the Board, such site should be dedicated to the City or reserved for acquisition by the City within a specified period of time.  An agreement should be reached between the subdivider and the appropriate public agency regarding time, method, and cost of such acquisition.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Land which is subject to periodic flooding, land which cannot be properly drained, or other land which in the opinion of the Board is unsuitable for residential use shall not be subdivided; except that the Board may approve subdivision of such land upon receipt of evidence from the County Health Department and/or the City Engineer that the construction of specific improvements can be expected to render the land suitable; thereafter, construction upon such land shall be prohibited until the specified improvements have been planned and construction guaranteed.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub963b">(B)	STREET LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Street layout shall provide for the continuation of such streets as the Department may designate.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Whenever a tract to be subdivided is located within an area for which a &quot;neighborhood plan&quot; has been approved, the boundaries of the subdivision shall be adjusted, where possible, to avoid the necessity for half-streets while maintaining substantial conformance to said Plan.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Certain proposed streets, as designated by the Department, shall be extended to the tract boundary to provide future connection with adjoining unplatted lands.<BR>
<BR> 4.	Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by through traffic.<BR>
<BR> 6.	Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial route, freeway or expressway, the Board may require frontage streets or reverse frontage with non-access easements along the arterial route, freeway or expressway, or such other treatment as may be justified for protection of residential properties from the nuisance and hazard of high volume traffic, and to preserve the traffic function of the arterial route, freeway or expressway.<BR>
<BR> 7.	Where a subdivision abuts or contains the right-of-way of a railroad, a limited access highway, or an irrigation canal, or abuts a commercial or industrial land use, the subdivider may be required to locate a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land.  Such distance shall be determined with due regard for approach grades, drainage, bridges, or future grade separations.<BR>
<BR> 8.	Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to produce desirable lots of maximum utility, streets of reasonable gradient, and the facilitation of adequate drainage.<BR>
<BR> 9.	Alleys are not required in residential subdivisions, except that the Board may require that they be dedicated in certain situations to complete existing patterns or to serve as secondary access to adjacent properties.  Alleys may be required in commercial and industrial subdivisions as approved by the Board.<BR>
<BR>10.	Half-streets shall be avoided except where necessary to provide right-of-way required to complete a street pattern already begun.  Where it is necessary to develop a half-street, additional right-of-way and street improvements may be required.  Where there exists a platted half-street abutting the tract to be subdivided, the remaining half shall be platted within the tract.<BR>
<BR>11.	Where private streets are approved, statements shall be contained on the plat and in both the deed restrictions and the homeowners association by-laws that those streets are declared private subject to an easement authorizing use by emergency and public service vehicles, and remain the permanent responsibility of the homeowners association.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub963c">(C)	STREET DESIGN:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	The design of streets and alleys shall conform to standards established by the City.<BR><UL>
(a)	Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular right-of-way, fifty feet (50') in radius, with an improved traffic turning circle forty-two feet (42') in radius <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf3">(see Figure 3)</A>.  The staff may approve an equally effective form of space where extreme or special conditions justify <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf22">(see Figure 22)</A>.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Maximum length of cul-de-sac streets:  Four hundred feet (400'), measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines to the extreme depth of the turning circle along the street centerline.  Exceptions may be made by the Traffic Engineer and the City Engineer, where topography, adjacent platting or other unusual conditions justify <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf3">(see Figure 3)</A>.  No exception shall be made merely because the tract has restrictive boundary dimensions, wherein provisions should be made for extension of the street pattern to the adjoining unplatted parcel and a temporary turn around installed <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf22">(see Figure 22)</A>.<BR>
<BR> (c)	Alley intersection and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off twenty- five feet (25') on each side to permit safe vehicular movement, except a greater distance shall be provided where specified by the City Engineer <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf11">(see Figure 11)</A>.  Dead-end alleys are prohibited.<BR></UL>
<BR> 2.	Grades:<BR><UL>
(a)	Maximum:  <BR>
<UL>Arterial routes:  As determined by the City Engineer<BR>
Collector Streets:  7%<BR>
Local Streets:  9% (up to 15% in Desert Uplands, <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#sub965">see Section 9-6-5)</A></UL>.
<BR>(b)	Minimum grade for all streets shall be 0.20%.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Exceptions:  Where rigid adherence to these standards causes unreasonable or unwarranted hardship in design or cost without commensurate public benefit, exceptions may be made by the City Engineer.<BR></UL>
<BR> 3.	Vertical curves:<UL>
(a)	Arterial streets:  As determined by City Engineer.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Collector and local streets:  Minimum length one hundred feet (100') except in cases approved by City Engineer.</UL>
 4.	Horizontal alignment:<UL>
(a)	When tangent centerlines deflect from each other more than one degree (1&#176;) and less than ninety degrees (90&#176;), they shall be connected by a curve with a minimum centerline radius of three hundred feet (300') and a minimum centerline length of curve of one hundred feet (100') for local streets <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf6">(see Figure 6)</A>.  When tangent centerlines on arterial and collector streets deflect from each other more than one degree (1&#176;) and less than ninety degrees (90&#176;), they shall be connected by a curve with a minimum centerline length of curve based on the data in the Curve Table.<BR>
<BR>(b)	A tangent is not required between reverse curves on a local street.  Between reverse curves on collector and arterial streets refer to the Curve Table of this Section.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Streets intersecting an arterial street shall do so at an angle of ninety degrees (90&#176;).  Intersections of other streets shall not vary from ninety degrees (90&#176;) unless otherwise approved by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer.<BR>
<BR> (d) Street jogs with centerline offsets shall be not less than one hundred twenty five feet (125') on local and forty foot (40') wide collector streets.  On all other collector streets, offsets shall be not less than two hundred fifty feet (250').  On arterial streets, offsets shall be not less than three hundred twenty five feet (325'), unless otherwise approved by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf7">(see Figure 7)</A>.<BR>
<BR>(e)	Local street intersections with four (4) legs and all collector and arterial street intersections shall be designed to comply with the curve and tangent section requirements given in the Curve Table of this Section, unless otherwise approved by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf6">(see Figure 6)</A>.<BR>
<BR>(f)	Local streets intersecting any street shall have a tangent section of centerline at least two hundred feet (200') in length measured from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street; except that no such tangent is required when the local street curve has a centerline radius of four hundred feet (400') or greater and is the terminating street at a &quot;tee&quot; intersection, with the center located on the intersecting street right-of-way line.  Where topographic conditions make necessary other treatment to secure the best overall design, these standards may be modified by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf6">(see Figure 6)</A>.<BR>
<BR>(g)	Street intersections with more than four (4) legs and Y-type intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be prohibited.  Intersections on the inside of a horizontal curve on arterial, collector, or local streets shall be avoided, unless otherwise approved by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf9">(see Figure 9)</A>.<BR>
<BR>(h)	At all street intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by a circular arc, said arc having a minimum radius of fifteen feet (15') or by a cut-off whose tangent lengths would be equal to those of a rounded corner <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf5">(see Figure 5)</A>.<BR>
<BR>(i)	All street intersections shall be designed to meet minimum sight distance visibility requirements <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf20">(see Figure 20)</A>.<BR></UL>
<BR> 5.	Private Streets:  Private streets shall conform to above stated design standards.  Where site conditions necessitate unique design solutions, modifications may be approved by the City Engineer.<BR>
<BR> 6.	Half-streets:  Half-streets shall conform to the above stated design standards. They shall, however, be a minimum of twenty four feet (24') wide measured from the face of the curb to the edge of the asphaltic pavement.  Additional right-of-way, in excess of that normally required for one-half (&#189;) of a street of that classification, may be required as determined by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer.<BR>

</TABLE><BR>
NOTES:<BR>
<BR>(1)	Minimum length of tangent between curves in opposite directions (reverse curves).  Reverse curves without tangent sections between the curves are not permitted, except on local streets.<BR>
<BR>(2)	Minimum length of a tangent at an intersection is measured from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street.  Tangents approaching an intersection may vary in length with increased design speed.<BR>
<P>Special conditions may warrant the use of other variables subject to review and special approval by the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer.<BR>
 <BR>
<B><A NAME="sub963d">(D)	BLOCK DESIGN:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	The maximum length of blocks measured along the centerline of the street, and between intersecting street centerlines, is fifteen hundred feet (1500'); except that in a development with lot areas averaging one-half (&#189;) acre or more, or where conditions warrant, this maximum may be exceeded by five hundred feet (500').  Blocks shall be as long as reasonably possible under the circumstances within the above maximums in order to achieve depth and possible <BR>
street economy and to reduce the expense and safety hazard arising from excessive street intersections <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf10">(see Figure 10)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Pedestrian/Bicycle ways:  Pedestrian/bicycle ways with right-of-way widths of ten to twelve feet (10-12') may be required where essential for circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.  Pedestrian/bicycle ways may also be used for utility and drainage purposes if so noted on the plat and approved by the Engineering Department <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf11">(see Figure 11)</A>.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub963e">(E)	LOT PLANNING:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Lot width, depth, and area shall comply with the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and shall be appropriate for the location and character of development proposed and for the type and extent of street and utility improvements being installed.  In general, urban densities must have urban street and utility improvements.  The term &quot;urban improvements&quot; is interpreted to mean paved and curbed streets, sidewalks, local storm drainage system, public water supply, fire protection, street lights and public sanitary sewerage.  <BR>
<BR>Where steep topography, unusual soil conditions, drainage problems, abrupt changes in land use or heavy traffic on adjacent streets prevail, the Board may make special lot width, depth, and area requirements which exceed the minimum requirements of the particular zoning district.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Lot depths should be at least ninety-four feet (94') and the depth-to-width ratio of the usable area of the lot not greater than three (3) to one (1) <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf12">(see Figure 12)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines, except where other treatment may be justified in the opinion of the Board <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf13">(see Figure 13)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 4.	All lots shall have frontage as required by the appropriate zoning district on a fully dedicated public street unless otherwise approved.<BR>
<BR> 5.	Single residential lots on curvilinear streets shall have rear lot lines consisting of a series of straight lines with points of deflection occurring only at the junction of side and rear lot lines unless otherwise approved.  Curvilinear rear lot lines with a minimum radius of eight hundred feet (800') will be permitted <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf14">(see Figure 14)</A>.<BR>
<BR>  6. The street side rear corner of corner lots adjacent to &quot;key&quot; lots shall be angled to provide a 10' x 10' cut-off <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf14">(see Figure 14)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 7.	Single residential lots extending through the block and having frontage on two (2) parallel local streets are not permitted.  Backing of the lots to collector streets shall be avoided except where necessary in the opinion of the Board to provide for separation of residential development from the collector street; or <BR>
where expressly permitted in accordance with Subsection (B)6. of this Section <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf15">(see Figure 15)</A>.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub963f">(F)	EASEMENT PLANNING:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Easements for utilities shall be provided as follows:<UL>
(a)	Along all local streets, minimum eight foot (8') wide public utility and facilities easements (PUFE's) shall be provided; along arterial, collector and other major thoroughfares, widths shall be as determined by the Technical Review Committee.<BR>
<BR>(b)	In Planned Area Developments (PAD's), commercial and industrial centers and other similarly developed projects, easement location and widths other than those along public streets will be determined by the Technical Review Committee.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Other easements deemed necessary to provide utility or other services shall be provided as required by the Technical Review Committee.<BR></UL>
<BR> 2.	For lots facing on curvilinear streets, utility easements shall consist of a curved line parallel to the front property line and a series of straight line segments or a curved line parallel to the rear property lines as may be required to complete an existing easement system.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Where a stream or important surface drainage course abuts or crosses the tract, dedication of a drainage easement of a width sufficient to permit widening, deepening, relocating, or protecting and maintaining said water course shall be required.<BR>
<BR> 4.	Land within a major drainage, flood, or transmission easement shall not be considered a part of the minimum required lot area except where lots exceed one-half (&#189;) acre in area <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf16">(see Figure 16)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 5.	Where alleys and/or eight foot (8') PUFE's exist in adjacent subdivisions, this pattern shall be continued unless otherwise approved by the Technical Review Committee <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf17">(see Figure 17)</A>.<BR>
<BR>  6.  Where alleys are provided in multiple residence or commercial areas, a refuse container easement may be required of sufficient size as determined by the present City standards <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf18">(see Figure 18)</A>.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub963g">(G)	STREET NAMING:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	The subdivider shall indicate the street name for public streets on the preliminary plat by projecting existing north-south and east-west street names that fall in alignment.  When no current streets are in alignment, the subdivider may propose a name based on the MAG and City of Mesa street naming policy.  The street name shall be one not in use in any adjacent community.  All names are subject to final approval by City staff at the technical review stage.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Private streets, aisles or drives in PAD's shall not be named or numbered.  The site will receive a single address based on the public street on which it fronts.  Lots, homes, units and spaces, within the project will be assigned a sub-address by the City staff for mail delivery, emergency or other service needs.<BR>

<BR> 1.	A complete set of engineering plans for construction of all required improvements shall be prepared by an engineer registered in Arizona.  Such plans shall be based on the technical review of the Preliminary Plat and be prepared in conjunction with the Final Plat.  (Refer to Engineering Procedure Manual for more specific and detailed requirements for this Section.)<BR>
<BR> 2.	No plat shall be recorded until the engineering plans have been approved by the City.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub964c">(C)	CONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	All improvements in the public right-of-way shall be constructed under the inspection and approval of the City Engineer.  Construction shall not commence until a permit has been issued for such construction.  Work shall not be discontinued or suspended unless first approved by the City Engineer and it shall not be resumed prior to notification and approval of the Engineering Department.<BR>
<BR> 2.	All underground utilities to be installed in streets and alleys shall be constructed, inspected and approved prior to the surfacing of such streets and alleys.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub964d">(D)	PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:</A></B><BR>
<BR>The City Engineer is hereby delegated authority to develop and apply such engineering standards, specifications and procedures for the design and construction of public improvements as are in harmony with the objectives of this Section and necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, safety and welfare.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d1"> 1.	Streets:</A>  All streets within the subdivision, including perimeter streets or half-streets, shall be paved including concrete curbs installed to lines, grades and dimensions approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with City<BR>
 standards.  When a major collector or arterial street is included within the subdivision or is a perimeter street, the City may pay for such extra width paving as may be deemed appropriate by the City.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d2"> 2.	Alleys:</A>  All alleys within the subdivision, including perimeter alleys and partial alleys, shall be surfaced with granite or Aggregate Base Course (ABC) to grades and dimensions approved by the City Engineer in conformance with City standards.  Alleys to be used for primary vehicular access as defined under Section 9-5-1 of the <A HREF="http://www.ci.mesa.az.us/codebook/main.htm">City Code</A> shall be improved as required by said Section and in conformance with City Standards.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d3"> 3.	Sidewalks:</A>  Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all streets within the subdivision and along one side of perimeter streets to a width and to lines and grades approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with City standards.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d4"> 4.	Water and Sewer Lines and Services:</A>  Water and sewer lines shall be installed within the subdivision to lines and grades and of such sizes and lengths as approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with City standards.  Water and sewer service lines of sizes and at locations approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with City standards shall be installed for each lot within the subdivision prior to paving the street and improving the alleys.  Service stubs to platted lots and tracts within the subdivision for underground utilities shall be placed to such length and size as not to necessitate disturbance of street and utility improvements when future service connections are made.  Where it is necessary to extend a water or sewer main from an existing adequate main to the subdivision, the subdivider will be required to pay the full cost of the line extension.  However, if so requested, the City may participate in the oversize cost, or enter into a &quot;private line agreement&quot; with the subdivider requiring the subsequent users to pay a share of the cost of the line extension at such time as they take service from the line extension if such service is taken during the term of the agreement.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d5"> 5.	Fire Hydrants:</A>  Fire hydrants shall be installed within and along perimeter streets of the subdivision at locations and to lines and grades approved by the City Engineer, Fire Department and in conformance with City standards.  <BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d6"> 6.	Gas:</A>  Gas service may be furnished according to current available supplies as determined by the City or other franchised supplier for that area.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d7"> 7.	Irrigation Lines and Ditches:</A>  All irrigation and other ditches within the subdivision or within perimeter half-streets or alleys or easements shall be tiled or abandoned, in accordance with plans and specifications as approved by the City Engineer and/or respective irrigation district.  <BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d8">  8. Storm Drainage:</A>  The Subdivider shall make provisions for the retention and subsequent bleed off of all storm water within the proposed subdivision in accordance with plans approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with City standards.  The plans shall show the type, extent, location and capacity of existing and proposed drainage and retention that may affect the subdivision.  Complete hydrology and hydraulic design computations shall accompany the plans and shall be approved prior to the recordation of the final plat.  The design shall be based on a 100 year 2 hour storm.  Once constructed and approved by the City, the drainage facilities shall not be modified, unless such modification is approved by the City Engineer.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d9"> 9.	Retention Basins:</A>  Public retention basins are encouraged to provide additional land area (up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the basin size) above the minimum land area calculated to retain their specified volume of water to help insure that public basins provide usable &quot;flat&quot; areas for recreational purposes.  The design, amount, and location of the additional area which could be provided should be considered in the initial design of the project.  The need for additional open space, and the design of the basin will be reviewed by the staff on a project by project basis to help insure that adequate recreational facilities are provided to serve the needs of the future residents of the proposed subdivision.  Multiple small retention basins are not acceptable for either public or private developments unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer and in conformance with City standards.  Upon completion of an approved maintenance period for a public retention basin that will be maintained by the City, the subdivider shall provide at no cost to the City a clear title to the public retention basin.  Once constructed and approved by the city, the retention facilities shall not be modified, unless such modification is approved by the City Engineer.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d10">10.	Street Lights:</A>  Street lights shall be installed along all streets within the subdivision and along all perimeter streets developed in conjunction with the subdivision.  Street lights shall be installed by the subdivider in accordance with plans approved by the Engineering Department and in conformance with City standards.  For a single parcel development with less than one hundred fifty feet (150') of street frontage, the City Engineer may waive the required street light installation.  If installation is waived, prior to the issuance of a building permit, the subdivider shall pay an amount determined by the City based on the street frontage to pay for the future installation of street lights by the City or others.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d11">11.	Street Name Signs:</A>  Street name signs shall be placed in all street intersections.  The subdivider shall install sign posts meeting City standards at locations designated by the City Engineer.  The sign posts shall be in place prior to the completion of street paving.  Prior to the issuance of a City permit for street paving, the subdivider shall pay to the City an amount per street name sign location as determined by the City Engineer to pay for the fabrication and installation of sign plates by the City.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d12"> 12.	Survey Monuments:</A>  Survey monuments conforming to City standards shall be installed at all corners, angle points, points of curves, and at all street intersections for streets within and around the perimeter of the subdivision and at such other locations as may be required by the City Engineer.  After all improvements have been installed, the subdivider's registered land surveyor shall check the location of the monuments and mark the brass cap.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d13">13.	Lot Corners:</A>  Iron pipe or round reinforced steel bars not less than one half inch (&#189;&quot;) in diameter shall be set at all corners, angle points, and points of curve for each lot within the subdivision prior to the recording of the plat, except that the City Engineer may approve a temporary delay where topographic conditions make it necessary.<BR>
<BR><A NAME="sub964d14">14.	Parkway Landscaping:</A>  Parkway areas along arterial streets and other streets, as deemed necessary by the City Engineer, shall be landscaped in accordance with approved plans and standards set by the City Engineer.

<FONT SIZE=5><B><A NAME="sub965">9-6-5:</A></B></FONT><BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965a">(A)	PURPOSE AND INTENT:</A></B><BR>
<BR>The purpose of these standards is to minimize hillside disturbance and encourage preservation of the natural character and aesthetic value of the desert within the Desert Uplands Area by allowing the flexibility necessary to produce unique, environmentally sensitive projects.  It is the intent of these standards to encourage development of subdivisions with a distinctive southwest desert design theme. <BR>
<BR>All present City design standards may not be applicable to desert preservation oriented development.  Due to the anticipated vehicular and pedestrian volumes normally associated with higher residential densities, developments within the R1-15 zone and higher density residential and non-residential uses shall generally comply with present City of Mesa Ordinance requirements.  Standard City requirements for subdivision design, storm water retention, right-of-way, pavement widths and street design shall apply, except in the following areas where alternatives may be permitted to maintain the natural desert character of the area.  <BR>
<BR>The Desert Uplands Area is that area of Mesa from East McKellips Road north to the Tonto National Forest boundary and from the C.A.P. (Central Arizona Project) Canal east to the Usery Mountain Recreation Area boundary.<BR>
<BR> 1.	'PAD's and non-residential developments will be reviewed at the time of zoning approval or building permit application review for compliance with applicable Desert Uplands Standards and for a southwestern design theme.<BR>
<BR> 2.	In lower density residential areas (R1-35 and lower), development standards similar to those for suburban areas may be approved. <BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965b">(B)	LOCAL STREETS:</A></B><BR>
<BR>Local street standards may be modified to encourage better adjustment to the topography of the area.  Existing significant topographical features, such as washes, hillsides, boulders and rock outcroppings, and established stands of native vegetation which cannot be revegetated, may warrant the approval of alternative engineering designs.  Modifications would be considered on an individual basis, with approval by the Mesa Planning Director, City Engineer and Traffic Engineer.  The following are requirements and design alternatives for street construction in the Desert Uplands Area.<BR>
<BR> 1.	Where topographical conditions warrant, cul-de-sac lengths in excess of four hundred feet (400') may be approved by the City Engineer if an improved turning radius of fifty-five feet (55') is provided to facilitate the turning radius of emergency vehicles.  In such situations, however, the Fire Department may require installation of individual protection systems where appropriate.  Cul-de-sacs should be designed to serve twelve (12) to fourteen (14) homes maximum, regardless of length.<BR>
<BR>  2.	With approval of the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer, minimum center line radius and curve lengths may be reduced <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf26">(see figure 26)</A>.  Local street intersections may vary from ninety degrees (90&#176;) on short street segments, at cul-de-sacs, or at the termination of streets where the traffic speeds and volumes are lower.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Maximum street grades may be increased, provided adequate visibility and access for fire protection and refuse collection vehicles is maintained.  Local street grades should not exceed fifteen percent (15%) and streets exceeding twelve percent (12%) should have a maximum length of four hundred feet (400').  Exceptions require approval of the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf26">(see Figure 26)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 4.	With approval of the Traffic Engineer and City Engineer, local and collector streets may be allowed with sidewalks on one side only where the character of the area and topographical conditions indicate significant pedestrian traffic is not expected.<BR>
<BR> 5.	Where scarring occurs as a result of street or utility construction, revegetation and restoration shall be required of the subdivider. Restored areas shall be graded and landscaped to blend with the natural vegetation and terrain, and stabilized to control erosion.  Landscaping and stabilization shall occur concurrently with construction.<BR>
<BR> 6.	Grade changes that require retaining walls may be used only with the approval of the City Engineer.  Where approved for use, vertical retaining walls shall have a maximum height of five feet (5').  For grade changes of more than five feet (5'), the use of multiple walls in a series of terraces is required.  Each terrace shall have a four foot (4') minimum width and shall be landscaped.  There shall be a four foot (4') landscaped strip between the top terrace and any free-standing enclosure wall used.  The finished surfaces of retaining walls shall blend into the natural setting by such means as texturing and the use of earth tone coloring.  The use of native stone as a veneer is also possible <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf27">(see Figure 27)</A>.<BR>
<BR>For slopes of sixty degrees (60&#176;) and less, mortar free stone retaining walls using irregularly shaped native boulders may be used, subject to structural and slope stability design considerations.  Landscaping of the slope shall be provided to produce a more natural appearance <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf27">(see Figure 27)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 7.	All excess excavated material shall be removed or incorporated as an integral part of the site development so that a natural look is maintained.<BR>
<BR> 8.	Low Density Development Standards:  Where residential densities are one (1) dwelling unit/acre (R1-35) or less, reduced right-of-way and pavement widths similar to the suburban street section for local streets may be approved.<UL>
(a)	Possible variations include forty foot (40') right-of-way, two foot (2') ribbon curb, thirty-one feet (31') of pavement lip to lip, with no sidewalk.<BR>
 Modifications to this alternative may be considered on an individual basis where unusual topographical conditions are present.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Where drainageways cross streets, culverts shall be installed to convey ten (10) year frequency storm flows under the pavement, with higher volume storm flows being allowed to flow over the pavement in dip sections (see Figures <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf29">29</A> and <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf30">30</A>). <BR>
<BR>For washes with low flows, deletion of the culvert may be permitted where a concrete dip section is provided, when approved by the City Engineer.<BR>
<BR>(c)	With approval of the City Engineer, the use of three foot (3') to five foot (5') roadside drainage swales with appropriate erosion protection to provide a natural appearance will be permitted in lieu of vertical curb and gutters to intercept and direct runoff <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf28">(see Figure 28)</A>. <BR>
<BR>(d)	The use of integral colored concrete for ribbon curbing is encouraged <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf26">(see Figure 26)</A>.<BR></UL>
<BR>
<B><A NAME="sub965c">(C)	STREET LIGHTS:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	The &quot;shoebox&quot; fully shielded streetlight fixture with a square pole shall be the standard fixture and pole in the Desert Uplands Area <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf31">(see Figure 31)</A>. <BR>
<BR> 2.	Street lights on arterial and collector streets shall comply with City standard illumination and spacing requirements.  Street lights may be installed in median islands where available, or at the back of sidewalk where medians do not exist.  Mounting height shall be thirty-five feet (35') on collector and arterial streets, when placed in the median, and forty feet (40') if installed at the back of sidewalk.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Street lights on local streets shall be placed at all intersections and at the end of cul-de-sacs that are more that two hundred feet (200') long.  On straight sections of roadway four hundred foot (400') spacing between lights may be used; however, other factors must also be evaluated, e.g. horizontal and vertical alignment.  Topographical conditions may require additional lighting. Mounting height on local streets shall be twenty-five feet (25'), with a one hundred (100) watt lamp.<BR>
<BR> 4.	Pull boxes shall be a maximum of two hundred feet (200') apart.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965d">(D)	ON-SITE STREET NAME SIGNS (PUBLIC STREETS):</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Street name signs and posts shall be standard (green reflectorized sign with white reflectorized lettering and a steel pole) unless the applicant receives approval of a modification from the Traffic Engineer.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Any approval of non-standard street sign materials shall be conditional upon the development's homeowner's association assuming responsibility for the installation, future maintenance and liability relating to the signs.<BR>
<BR>3.	Non-standard street name signs which are installed and maintained by a homeowner's association shall have reflective letters and  background.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965e">(E)	WALLS AND FENCES:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Perimeter subdivision walls shall be designed to reflect a southwestern design theme and be constructed to reflect changes in the topography (see Figure <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf31">31</A> and <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf32">32</A>).<BR>
<BR> 2.	Perimeter subdivision walls shall be designed and constructed in a height and style which preserves desert vistas and environment, unless otherwise approved <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf32">(see Figure 32)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Walls or fences on individual lots which are visible from the street should be designed to match the character and appearance of the home <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf26">(see Figure 26)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 4.	The use of chain link as a permanent fencing material is discouraged in the Desert Uplands area.<BR>
<BR> 5.	Low Density Development Standards:<BR><UL>
<BR>(a)	In larger lot subdivisions, the subdivider should confine fencing to the residential private activity areas, with the balance of the lot to remain open and unwalled.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Walls on individual lots should be designed to match the character and appearance of the home <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf26">(see Figure 26)</A>.<BR></UL>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965f">(F)	VEGETATION/REVEGETATION:</A></B><BR>
<BR>1.	Retained or transplanted cactus and ocotillo may be utilized to achieve up to fifty percent (50%) of the required number of trees to be planted in the street right-of-way.<BR>
<BR>2.	Thorny plants, cactus and ocotillo must maintain a minimum setback of seven feet (7') from sidewalks and/or vehicular roadways.  Such plants will be allowed in a curbed median island, provided a minimum of three feet (3') is maintained from curbs as a clear zone (measured from nearest part of plant) (see Figures <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf33">33</A> and <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf34">34</A>).<BR>
<BR>3.	Boulders and large diameter trees may be placed in large width median islands as design elements, if berming is provided for protection <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf34">(see Figure 34)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 4.	Thorny plants, cactus and ocotillo shall have a minimum of three buffer shrubs in front of such plants (pedestrian/street side) (see Figures <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf33">33</A> and <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf34">34</A>).  Examples of buffer shrubs are:  cassia varieties, texas sage, creosote, desert broom, sagebrush, etc.<BR>
<BR>5.	Transplanted native plants that die within one year are to be replaced within thirty (30) days of written notification by the City.  Replacements are to be indigenous plant material.  A bubbler or emitter irrigation system shall be extended to new or transplanted plants.<BR>
<BR>6.	Existing trees and cacti over six inches (6&quot;) in diameter, in common open space areas, should be preserved in place where possible.  When retention of plant material is not possible due to lot sizes or location, removal and replanting on other areas of the site is recommended.<BR>
<BR>7.	Vegetation shall be re-established by the subdivider on all graded areas and exposed cut and fill slopes, where appropriate.  Desert grasses, shrubs, trees and cacti with low water consumption requirements shall be used to prevent erosion and permit natural revegetation.<BR>
<BR>8.	Low Density Development Standards:  Existing trees and cacti over six inches (6&quot;) in diameter shall be preserved in place where possible.  When retention is not possible due to building site location, removal and replanting on other areas of the site is recommended.<BR>

<BR>The following are low density development standards.<BR>
<BR> 1.	The extent of all grading, (other than the enclosed area of a dwelling unit) for driveways, swimming pools, yards, corrals, paddocks, etc. and all accessory structures should be identified on the building plans and shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the total lot area.  Areas to be protected should be staked in the field prior to any grading or construction, with the areas outside of the staked building envelope remaining in an undisturbed state.<BR>
<BR> 2.	An open space or drainage easement should be provided for those lot areas with slopes of 15% or greater or natural area washes that may carry drainage.<BR>
<BR>  3.	Where open space easements are provided, the balance of the lot or the &quot;buildable area&quot; must have a useable shape and size and provide adequate street access.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965h">(H)	BUILDING HEIGHT/DENSITY:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Densities shall be determined by the underlying zoning district.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Building height shall be limited to two (2) stories or thirty feet (30'); or the maximum height permitted by the underlying zoning district; or Site Plan Approval as approved by the City Council.<BR>
<BR> 3.	All buildings shall be located below the ridge line <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf26">(see Figure 26)</A>.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965i">(I)	15% SLOPE/OPEN SPACE: </A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Slopes of 15% or greater should remain in undeveloped natural open space.<BR>
<BR> 2.	The open space within the lots, common open space areas with slopes of 15% or greater, or natural area washes that may carry drainage, should be identified and secured by an open space and/or drainage easement and be maintained by the lot owner or homeowners association.<BR>
<BR> 3.  Ridge lines should remain as undeveloped natural open space.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub965j">(J)	WASHES/DRAINAGE:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	Retained washes and new drainage channels shall be given a &quot;natural&quot; desert character where possible in accordance with the City's Engineering requirements.  Requirements may include landscaping with rock and native plant materials, use of integral colored gunite, contouring of the man made surface and preservation of existing natural features <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf35">(see Figure 35)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 2.	Non-turfed storm water retention basins are allowed in the Desert Uplands Area subject to conditions, locations and the City Engineer's approval.<BR>
<BR> 3.	Storm water retention basins shall be landscaped/revegetated with existing vegetation and native plant materials where appropriate in accordance with the approved landscape plan.  Terracing, berming and contouring will be encouraged to naturalize and enhance the aesthetics of the basin and to blend with the surrounding terrain.<BR>
<BR> 4.	Random sized rock (six inches (6&quot;) and larger) may be utilized to create a natural appearing desert wash within the basin bottom.  Basins are encouraged to provide up to twenty-five percent (25%) more land area than the minimum area necessary to retain their specified volume of water in order to allow for the creation of peninsulas, more &quot;natural&quot; contouring, and the placement of boulders and rock outcroppings.<BR>
<BR> 5.	Basin slopes shall not exceed a six to one (6 - 1, horizontal to vertical) slope adjacent to public streets. Remaining slopes shall not exceed a four to one (4 - 1) slope.  Deviations may be approved by the City Engineer if the lesser slope creates excessive grading of the existing desert environment <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf33">(see Figure 33)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 6.	The use of native materials in the construction of headwalls, flow retardant structures and devices, culverts and drainage channel bottoms is encouraged in the Desert Uplands area <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#subf30">(see Figure 30)</A>.<BR>
<BR> 7.	Low Density Development Standards:<BR><UL>
<BR>a.	Non-turfed drainage swales are allowed in the Desert Uplands Area. <BR>
<BR>b.	Erosion protection of drainage swales will be encouraged through the use of native rocks and native plant materials.  Where runoff velocities necessitate additional erosion protection, the use of integral colored gunite or alternative material may be approved by the City Engineer.<BR></UL>

<BR> 5.	To provide for water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, dust control and other requirements necessary to protect the environment and to promote the aesthetics of the City.<BR>
<BR> 6.	To allow the further intensification of land uses through the land split process only in areas that are improved with public facilities and provided with public services so that negative or undesirable impacts to the public are minimized.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub966b">(B)	APPLICABILITY:</A></B><BR>
<BR>The regulations contained in this Section shall apply to all divisions of land made within the corporate limits of the City of Mesa since January 1, 1974, or other divisions determined by the Planning Director to be a land split.<BR>
<BR>It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, or other legal entity to sell or offer a contract to sell any parcel that is subject to the requirements of this regulation until an approved land split map complying with the provisions of this regulation has been filed with the Community Development Department and approval given by the Planning Director.<BR>
<BR>The division of any property into four (4) or more parcels, or if a new street is involved, shall proceed through the subdivision process.  The division of any property, the boundaries of which have been fixed by a recorded plat into more than two (2) parcels, shall proceed through the subdivision process, unless waived by the Planning Director.  <BR>
<BR>The creation of two (2) three (3) or more units having the right of exclusive occupancy coupled with an undivided interest in the land, such as in a condominium, horizontal property regime, cooperative, community apartment, townhouse, or similar project, shall proceed through the subdivision process.<BR>
<BR> These regulations may be modified by the Planning Director when the division of land involves two (2) or more separately owned parcels which cannot be subdivided into lots in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in Section 9-6-2 of this regulation, and with the zoning regulations of the zoning district in which they are located.  All affected property owners must agree to the following:<BR>
<BR> 1.	To follow a &quot;Neighborhood Plan&quot; (NP) prepared either by the Department or others.<BR>
<BR> 2.	To dedicate their portion of any public street shown on the approved &quot;Neighborhood Plan&quot; (NP), at the time at least two (2) key parcels desire to subdivide as determined by the City Engineer and the Planning Director.<BR>
<BR> 3.	To provide the minimum standards for dust-proofing and road base support in accordance with Public Works and Fire Department standards necessary to support the vehicles that will serve this area.<BR>
<BR> 4.	To participate in any improvement district(s) initiated by the City or the property owners to provide water and sewer and other public street improvements.<BR>
<BR> 5.	To participate in any necessary land acquisitions to provide required drainage retention facilities to control flooding.<BR>
<BR>Boundary adjustment plats and deeds, where land taken from one (1) parcel is added to an adjacent parcel, shall not be considered to be a land split under the terms of this Section, provided that the proposed adjustment does not:  1) Create any new lots;  2) Render any existing lot substandard in size or shape;  3) Render substandard the setbacks to existing development on the affected property; and  4) Impair any existing access, easement, or public improvement.<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="sub966c">(C)	RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGULATIONS:</A></B><BR>
<BR> 1.	A land split shall conform to all applicable policies of the General Plan.<BR>

<BR> 1.	The division of land into two (2) or three (3) parcels and under those special conditions described in Subsection (B) of this Section, requires the approval of a land split map.  The purpose of the land split map review is to determine the appropriateness of the access and lot design with respect to the contours of the land, to determine if the setbacks of existing development on the site(s) are being rendered to be in violation with the creation of new lot lines, to determine if a subdivision is being created, and to determine the conformity of the proposed land split to City Policies and Ordinances.  Land splits shall proceed through the required approval process.  Anyone requesting land split map approval shall submit the following to the Community Development Department:<BR><UL>
<BR>(a)	A completed application form.<BR>
<BR>(b)	A list of real property owners with addresses adjacent to the parcel proposed to be split, as determined from the latest equalized assessment roll of the County Assessor's Office.<BR>
<BR>(c)	A chain of title or a history of the ownership of the parcel proposed to be split, dating back to January 1, 1974, furnished by a recognized title company.  Such information shall be presented so that it may be determined if the proposed land split does or does not constitute a subdivision.<BR></UL>
<BR> 2.	The information required for the land split map shall be shown graphically or by note on plans at a standard engineering scale large enough to show all details clearly.  The size of the map shall be either 18&quot; x 24&quot; or 24&quot; x 36&quot; and shall contain the following information:<BR><UL>
<BR>(a)	Name, address, and telephone number of the property owner(s).<BR>
<BR>(b)	Name, address, and telephone number of the engineer or land surveyor preparing the map, including professional seal and signature.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Graphic and written scale, north indicator (up or to the right), and date of preparation.<BR>
<BR>(d)	Legal description of the property.<BR>
<BR>(e)	The General Plan designation for the subject site.<BR>
<BR>(f)	The existing zoning classification of the subject site and adjacent properties.<BR>
<BR>(g)	The topography of the site shown at one foot (1') contour intervals if the site slopes less than five percent (5%); two foot (2') contour intervals if the site slopes up to twenty percent (20%); and five foot (5') contour intervals if the site slopes more than twenty percent (20%).  (This requirement may be waived by the Planning Director, upon documentation or good cause.)<BR>
<BR>(h)	The property boundaries of the existing site and of all property within one hundred fifty feet (150').<BR>
<BR>(i)	The parcel boundaries of the proposed parcels to be created and the net area (the area exclusive of roadways dedicated to the public) in square feet of each parcel.<BR>
<BR> (j) The location of existing streets and right-of-way proposed to be dedicated with all dimensions.<BR>

<BR> 3.	Community Development staff shall review the application and the proposed land split map for completeness and accuracy.  When deficiencies are determined, these shall be noted and relayed to the applicant.  No decision shall be rendered until the application is determined to be complete.  Department staff in evaluating and making decisions on land split proposals shall consider the following criteria:<BR><UL>
<BR>(a)	Consistency of the proposed land split with the General Plan.<BR>
<BR>(b)	Conformity of the proposed land split to the Zoning Ordinance.<BR>
<BR>(c)	Conformity of the proposed land split to <A HREF="../planning/subdiv.htm#sub963">Section 9-6-3</A> (Subdivision Design Principles and Standards) and other applicable sections of the Subdivision Regulations.<BR>
<BR>(d)	Conformity of the proposed land split with the City's existing street patterns and details.<BR>
<BR>(e)	Lot size and design results from the proposed land split in relation to the site's topography.<BR>
<BR>(f)	Determination from the title information and lot/street design that a subdivision is not being created.<BR>
<BR>(g)	Other pertinent criteria.<BR></UL>
<BR> 4.	An improper land split renders the property involved unsuitable for building and not entitled to a construction permit.<BR>
